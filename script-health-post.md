Google doesn't provide a way to monitor if your Google Ads scripts run on time.

So I built one. And it's free if you own any of my scripts or have been through any of my workshops.

Here's the problem: Scripts fail silently. Maybe Google's servers hiccup. Maybe someone breaks a shared sheet. Maybe API limits get hit. You'll only find out days later when a client asks why their reports stopped coming, or why the automation they paid you for stopped working.

This monitoring system watches all your Google Ads scripts and emails you within minutes if something stops working. Each script reports when it runs successfully. If one goes quiet, you get an alert.

Not spam, just one notification per issue. Tracks hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly scripts. Knows the difference between "running late" and "actually broken." Auto-clears alerts when scripts start working again.

The setup takes 5 minutes. You assign each script a simple ID number, add 10 lines of monitoring code to the end of your existing scripts, and specify how often each should run. The monitor checks every 15 minutes, something Google Ads scripts can't do since they're limited to hourly runs at most.

What makes this different from just logging to a sheet: it watches for what DOESN'T happen. A script that crashes or never starts can't report its own failure. That's why you need an external monitor, built in Apps Script, checking continuously.

Available free to all users of my PMax script and members of my Ads to AI community. Comment below or DM me if you'd like a copy.

Because the best error is the one you catch before your client does.
