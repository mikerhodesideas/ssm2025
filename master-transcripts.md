## Module 1: Script Basics

### Video 1-1: Script Basics (7 min)

Okay, Mike Rhodes here, welcome to scripts and sheets mastery Delighted to have you here. Um, in the coming videos, we're going to cover quite a bit of ground.
But let's start at the beginning. Why learn scripts? Why in would you want to or ? Would you want to learn scripts?
Well, I've got a few reasons for you here. Um, it's mostly going to be about automating repetitive manual work. There is absolutely no point to be downloading all of those reports that you need to do your job manually downloading those each week, each month, whatever it might be.
You can scale what you know to do. You have SOPs, you have systems, you have ways of doing things that you use to run Google accounts effectively.
You can scale that up so that certain tasks, not everything, certain tasks can be done at scale automatically, every day, every hour, if you really want finding those search terms that are costing you too much money, suggesting new negative terms and so many more things because we can now add the power
of intelligence to your automation. We'll get to that in a later video. Getting notified using scripts for alerts and automatic checks so that you can be proactively notified so that you don't have to go and check each one of your accounts or each one of your campaigns every day just to check that things
are running okay. You can be notified as soon as something isn't running okay and you get to define what okay is what those limits are.
Like I said, scripts can run every hour if you want. So if you need this thing running and letting you know as soon as a budget is hit or as soon as some new campaign spends over a critical amount or as soon as Google tries to spend double your daily budget or hits you with a keyword that costs you three
, four times more than your target CPA. You can be notified about all of that stuff and build systems to take care of that to pause the keyword or the campaigning question to change budgets automatically.
And we're going to dive into Google Sheets because this is really where all of your data is going to live outside of Google Ads.
We're going to automate a bunch of stuff to pull data into Google Sheets, which means that just knowing a little bit about how to get the most out of Google Sheets can really help.
And as you'll see, as we get into the videos, this can really be the main hub of all of your automation, not just for Google Ads, but we can actually start to build automation that can help with any other type of, well, as I was going say, any other type of marketing, Facebook ads or Shopify data, but
really any data in your business, we can use this for, but just before we get into it, I do want to point out it is not a magic panacea.
It's not silver bullet. There are going to be limitations. It isn't going to replace you. You don't need to worry about that, but it can't do everything.
So it'll help us automate tasks, but it's not going to make those big strategic decisions. We can add the power of intelligence to help with some decision-making, but obviously AI being what it is at this point You're not going to trust that % to make certainly not big important decisions They're 
not going to fix stuff just by running a script. They're going to tell you what is happening They can automate that we can alert you we can do all sorts of stuff, but they can't magically fix something that just isn't that good to start with.
They can only run for minutes. So we have to be a little bit careful sometimes about what we actually put into a script.
Most of the time this isn't gonna be a problem, but it is worth knowing that there is a limitation there.
And they only work inside Google Ads, but I do have a couple of little tricks around that where we can work with other tools, even though those tools are not Google Ads.
But most of the time we'll be working with Google Ads data and sending that data to a Google Sheet. We'll do a little bit more outside that.
Now where I want to start is on my site, atiagent.com, you can go there right now and if you go into this, learn the basics section, I'm actually going to walk you through, for this first module, I'm going to walk you through the basics so that you get to sort of understand what scripts Canon can't
do and exactly how to use them. starting at the really, really basic level of just this simple little script here which is just going to send a little hello message on the screen.
Now, if you really want, you can work through here and read every single thing on here and tick these off as you go or we can just move a little bit faster and dive in here and hit that copy code button.
And then it's telling us exactly what to do. So rather than read that out to you on the screen, I'm just going to jump straight into a Google ads account here.
And I've gone into tools and scripts. And I've hit the big blue plus sign to start a new script. And we come in here and you'll do this almost every time you install the script.
Almost every time you're going to be copying and pasting a script from somewhere else. It might be one of mine.
It might be one of the many others that you're going to find online or it may be from an AI and you paste it from the AI into here.
And so what I normally do is come into this main script canvas area and just control A to highlight everything and then delete what's there.
So I've got a completely blank screen and then I'm going to paste in that script that we just copied to the clipboard.
Now we could give it a name at this point, but what most people are going to do at this point is hit run and that's fine, it will run, but then you're going to have to click around a bit to find the messages that the scripts are giving you known as logs.
So instead we're going to click the preview button because clicking the preview button enables us to see what's happening while the script is running.
If we just come across into logs here, you can see that we see this log message. It's not doing anything.
It's not changing the account. It's just showing how easy it is. If you copy and paste, you can use Google ads scripts.
So that worked. We saw a message down the bottom. If we go back over to here, it's telling us exactly what to do.
And we say, yep, I've run the code. Did you see this? Yes, that's exactly what we saw. Fantastic. Let the confetti begin and then we'll move to the next video of next level in the next video.

### Video 1-2: Script Basics (9 min)

Welcome back. Alright, let's dive into level two of our little script challenge now. Um, so again, we're not doing anything complicated at this point.
The main thing really at this stage is just to get comfortable with copying and pasting, with changing scripts, with understanding logs.
So we're gonna copy that code, again, we don't need to tick all of these things off. They're just there for the OCD types like me.
And we go into Google Ads again. Now, we could create a new script every time for this. But again, it's easiest at this point, just to delete what we have, command A or control A to highlight everything and then delete and then paste in that new code from the clipboard.
And again, now where's that preview button gone? You might be saying, because I've got this little section here that because I'm zoomed so far in, if I zoom out, you'll be able to see it.
You can see it down in the bottom right hand corner there. But because I'm zoomed in to make this a bit more readable for you.
I'm actually going to have to scroll down the screen to find that preview button. Again, we could press run. Maybe we'll do that anyway.
We get this option to run without preview. Preview is generally a safer way to do it. I also find it more useful because I get to see those logs while things are running.
But just so that you understand and what happens if you do hit run. Then we disappear off into the script history screen.
You can see our script running there. You don't see any log for the previous time that we ran this because we just previewed it.
We didn't actually run it, run it. And then we can click into the logs for this one, which is showing us exactly what we expect to the account name and the account ID.
Now if we go back to here, Yep, I've run the code, is this what you saw? Yes, it is, wonderful, confetti time again, and we can jump through to the next level.
So it doesn't really matter if you hit run or preview most of the time. I just think previewing is generally a better option for all those reasons that we've talked about.
Okay, so another bit of code. We can copy that and then we'll go back delete all of that, paste that in.
Now this time we're starting to think about the various metrics that we can pull out of an account, and this is going to grab metrics just for yesterday.
So we'll preview that whenever we hit preview, it opens up with these options down the bottom here, and I always go across and click on to logs.
I usually try and wind this up as far as possible, but again, because I'm zoomed so far into the screen I can't move that any further, but I'm getting impressions, clicks and cost.
I can go back across to here and say, yep, I've run the code, did it look like this? Yes, it did.
Fantastic. So now we get the idea that we can start to pull information about the account that we're in, and this is just for a single account for the time being okay.
We're not going to talk about MCC yet, but we will get to that later on in this workshop. So let's go get some data for a different date range this time.
So now we can copy the code, take it back across to here, delete all of that, paste the new one in, find the preview button, hit preview, and because we're putting this over the top of where we were before, we don't have to change to the log tab this time, it's already done for us.
And so now we're starting to get the idea that okay there are a lot more metrics and we're not scratching the surface here.
There's loads of different metrics that we could pull but we're just starting nice and simple here but we can change the date range that we get those metrics for.
All right so far so good. We've done level four. Congratulations. So now we're getting into something a little bit more funky.
We're going to save the data to a Google sheet. So it says copy the code and paste it into Google ads.
So let's go do that first. Now this time before we hit run, let's just check with the rules here and see what we need to do.
Click Preview and this time we're going to have to authorize the script. All right, let's try that. So we're going to click Preview and now because we're dealing with spreadsheets, because we're dealing with a different service.
It's still a Google service, but it's a different service to Google ads. Ah, okay. I know what's happened here. You're not going to see the screen pop up because in this particular script, remember, I cheated and I didn't create a new script at the beginning.
I put this over the top of an existing script, which I've already authorized, which is my bad. But rather than sort of show a whole, I don't want to show a whole bunch of scripts that are already in this particular account.
So just know that when you go into scripts and you click that big blue plus button, if it's a new script that you've never authorized, when you try and preview or run that script, usually you're going to see a little authorize banner pop up, usually yellow.
Sometimes it'll show across the top here. Sometimes you'll have to scroll down a little bit to see it right across the bottom here and you'll need to click authorize that O-auth screen pops up.
It looks a little scary. It says something along the lines of this script could, it won't, but could make changes to your account and delete things in your account.
And some people get freaked out by that. It's just a standard warning that Google show for every single script. They haven't actually read the contents of your script and determined what it can and can't do.
I guess they don't want that liability, right? Google's run by lawyers. So they're putting up the big The scariest possible warning of all of the things that a script could possibly do, don't worry, we're going to cover that in a later video of being able to find out exactly what a particular script 
is going to do using the power of AI. We'll get to that in a later video. So you can see here, it said that it has created a Google sheet for us.
So if we copy that, open up a new tab and paste that in, we can open up the new tab.
not super easy to see at this size but we have a bunch of metrics and we have a bunch of values so now great we know that we can send data to a Google sheet and it's just as quick as seeing that in the logs but we don't want to have to go back to the logs and check the logs every single time we don't
want to have to keep going back to that place. Having data sent to a sheet, and obviously this created a new sheet for us, but as we'll see soon, we can send data to this same sheet every single time.
So, let's come back into here and say yep, I've done that, did we see a sheet URL? Yes, we did, fantastic.
We have finished level five, well done. Right, so now that we're getting to hang on this, we're going to do a slightly different way of getting data.
So this time we're going to create three separate tabs in that Google sheet. So let's copy the code, go back into Google, highlight all of that code, delete it, and paste the new code in.
And then we'll come down the bottom here again and hit preview. Now, what's going to happen this time, do you reckon?
We're going to get a couple of seconds longer, and I reckon it's going to give us another sheet URL. But this time, we're running three separate queries, or three separate questions of our Google Ads data.
So it's going to take it just at that little bit longer. Let me go back in here and tidy this up, get rid of that tab while we're waiting.
Now this says, yep, okay, I've run the code. And again, it's going to say that we should see a URL pop up in the logs down here.

## Module 2: Custom Scripts

### Video 2-1: Custom Scripts (14 min)

Welcome back to module In this module, we're going to talk about how to customize scripts, um, again, whether they're mine, someone else is, something you found online, or something that AI created for you.
So, let's dive into my free site. So, if you go to microads.circle.sebit of a mouthful, um, I think if you go to microads.com.au, it'll redirect you here anyway.
And then come into this free script section and let's grab the Ngram one. So it's people like playing with Ngrams and if we come down to the code here, we're just going to copy and paste all of this code and pop that into our same area that we did before just going to delete what's there and paste this
script in. Now this time, it's a little bit different at the top here. So this time it's telling us to copy a template sheet.
So let's grab that URL there, including the slash copy on the end. If we copy that and paste it into a new tab, then we get Google Sheets Copy Document message.
So we're going to say, yes, make a copy of this, please. Now, this isn't anything crazy right. We've done this before.
We know that if we've got a Google sheet, we're going to then copy that URL. I'm going to grab the whole thing, gobblingoog and all, and stick it in between those single quotes.
So this is why that scary challenge. If you went through module one, that's what we did in module one was just cover all of the basics.
If you skip the head to module two, then I'm guessing you understand how to copy sheets and copy and paste URLs and put them in between the single quotes here.
And let's have as a client code module two, and we're just going to hit preview again so that we can see the logs while the script is running, rather than hit run, disappear off to a different screen, and have to click again to find those logs.
This shouldn't take very long to run, give it a few seconds, and we'll see a log saying, yep, I'm starting, I'm going off, I'm having a think about this, doing some stuff with Ngrams, which hopefully you've used before, these are Ngrams for products in here.
And yep, it started that as finished, seconds, lovely. Now if we go over to our sheet which was blank before we now see that we've got a couple of tabs filled with data.
I'll let you discover this later on. This is showing us the performance of individual words in our product titles as compared with how many people are searching for those for products and then also for search categories inside of PMAX campaign.
This is a little tiny corner of my main PMAX script, essentially. Now, when we went through the challenge in module one, we were just copying and pasting code, and it was kind of throw away code.
But now that we've got some code here that we might want to keep, we might want to use over and over again, we might want to start building a little library of various scripts that we find.
So, let's copy and paste this whole thing with our sheet URL and our client code here. And the reason for that client code, by the way, you can see it just got added to the name of the sheet.
So I'll often do that. Have something at the top where you can put in a little code or a name that represents the client that you're working on just to help you organize the sheets because otherwise trying to find some sheet later on in Google Drive when everything is named the same, you're not very 
easy. So now what I want to do is switch over to a tool called cursor. Now, don't freak out. This may seem a scary place to be, but it's going to come in so, so handy as we start to expand what's possible with scripts.
And as we start to maybe write our own scripts, but more importantly, given that it's halfway through while I'm recording this, get AI to help us with this.
So cursor is the tool that I've been using all day every day for gosh, over a year and a half at this point.
It's where I write all of my scripts. It's where I edit and change stuff. It's also where I build tools like 
So we basically have three main parts to cursor. It's not nearly as scary as it looks. Over here on the side, we've got a file editor.
So over here we can create files and folders. So let's create a folder and call it scripts. And then let's create a new file in here.
Let's call that ingram. And I'm going to put .js on the end, which just tells cursor, hey, this is a JavaScript piece of text that I'm pasting in here.
The benefit of that is it then changes all of the colors of this code, which makes the code easier to read.
Different colors mean different things. We don't really need to worry about that because we're not trying to learn how to write JavaScript, but we are going to be editing and tweaking scripts.
And so this just makes life much much easier. So we can build up a little library over here of all of the different scripts.
If you really wanted, you could come in here at level one, again, .js, level two, level three, and you could go and copy all of the scripts from the scary challenge that we went through or better yet, actually, we'll go to agent where we started right at the beginning of the first video, go back
to that scripts page and we went through this scary challenge last time but I've got a bunch of free scripts in here on this CS page and so these would be four great scripts to download and play with, just scroll down the page and each section has a little bit of blurb that tells you what it is.
You can, if you want, come in here and look at the code, but I've made it really easy for you.
You can just hit the big copy script button. Let's go back into cursor. Let's change this from being level or CS, part and then paste that code in there.
So I would highly suggest. Highly suggest, I don't think that's a phrase, Mike. Okay, that you create just to get you comfortable with using cursor, which by the way, if you just go to cursor.com, I didn't actually tell you that bit.
Did I get a cursor.com and then just the homepage of that. Oh, it wants to direct me to agents. Oh, that's you.
Okay, because I'm logged into my cursor account. I'm guessing it's going to keep poking you back in and out of there.
Okay, let's log out of that. Oh, there was a download button. If you get a cursor.com, then you can just hit the big download button for whatever system you're on.
And then install that. Start with the free version. Very quickly, you'll probably want to pay them the $a month for the paid version.
But if you're only creating editing scripts a few minutes a week, Don't bother paying them $just use the free version for it now.
But download cursor, get it installed on whatever computer you're using, and it looks like this. You can change the colors you can have light mode, dark mode, all that fancy stuff, but we can start to have that library.
Now I said three screens, right? So far we're only seeing two. We've got files over on the side here. In the middle, we've got our code.
We've got our canvas, which is where we're going to play with code. and then there's a few different ways to do this, but usually I will use these little buttons right up in the top right-hand corner to open up this right-hand pane.
And this is basically chatGPT or Claude or whichever AI you tend to use right here in the same place where we're writing and editing code and storing code.
So we get to do everything in the same place, but feels like I'm getting ahead of myself. feels like we're diving in at the deep end.
So let's instead go back and think about AI, okay? We're using chatgbt or Claude.ai if you prefer.
And let's do this. Let's start with this. We've got our ngram script that we copied before. Let's copy that to the clipboard again.
Go back into chat GBT and basically say let's say explain this code to me and paste that in and hit go because we want to understand if we don't know anything about this code, is it going to change anything in my account?
Is it going to affect my account in any way? And so at a high level it then tells us what it's going to do, and then even gives us a line by line breakdown.
So if you do want to learn more about how to code, about how to write JavaScript, which is the coding language that these are built in, this is a fantastic tool.
When I was learning to code again three or four years ago, I learned a long time ago, but I was learning again and I actually hired a guy that I would chat to once a week for an hour.
It was $$an hour, I think. And I would ask him about the code that I was trying to write.
And why did I get this error? And why are we doing it this way? And not that way. Chat GBT is a wonderful replacement for that.
Or indeed, Clote. Clote. Clored. Explain this code to me. We paste that in. So the UI is slightly different when you paste big chunks of text in, it kind of makes things a little bit easier to read as you add all of your attachments in here, but it's roughly the same sort of thing.
Now we're going to get different answers each time. Obviously. But you can see very, very similar kind of reply at a high level.
Here's the purpose of it. This is what it does. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, wonderful. So start there, start asking questions about scripts, because that's then the next phase to move on to is then having AI edit scripts for us and ultimately write entirely new scripts for us.
But we'll cover that in the next module. Don't want to get ahead of myself. But this AI rather than, well, what we will get to the point of doing as using AI as I say to edit and write scripts but if you're doing it in chat GPT or Claude or Groc or whatever it is that you use you're going to be doing
a lot of copying and pasting back and forth and as you've probably seen from here this is a really horrible place to try and edit and change our code you know if this said oh you need to change this line from this to this to do that in here we'd be scrolling through here trying to find the exact line
. It's really horrible place to try and edit code and that's why I would highly highly recommend you have a little play with the free version of cursor because when we ask the AI question here we can do the same thing here.
We can ask it AI to make changes to our code. And it is able to edit the file right here.
We can choose to be in control of that and approve the changes or not. Or we can just let it rip and write a whole bunch of code for us.
I'm actually asking it to explain the different code on there now. I've asked it to explain that first script from CS rather than Ngram because that's the one I had highlighted.
And so that's the one I thought I was talking about. So that's why you're seeing It's completely different answer there, my bad.
Using all of these things together in the same place just makes life so much easier and this is so much of a nicer place to edit.
It also has this magical quality of understanding what it is that you're trying to do. So if I delete this date range here, where it says yes today and I start typing last last, it just knows that I probably mean last days, which is exactly what I was going to type.
Now if I hit tab to write the last days and I come down here, it's highlighted this little part.
We can't really see it because of this, but we've highlighted this little part and if I hit tab again, it changes that log message that's going to be shown to the user, instead of saying received impressions yesterday, it's changed that and it hasn't just put But last, underscore underscore days 
turned it into something nice and easy to read. Try doing that in the Google Ads UI. Now, you may not need this sort of advanced functionality yet, but as you start getting even a little bit more familiar with Google Ads scripts, as you start to see the power of scripts and what is possible to create
with really, at this point, very, very little work, very little effort on your part, your job is using the imagination of what would you like the script to do.
And like I've said, there's loads of scripts out there online. I've got a bunch, Nils has got a bunch, Fred's got a bunch, there's a whole stack of people writing wonderful scripts these days and sharing them.
You'll find heaps of free scripts on LinkedIn. Start to build your own little library. Start to chat to the AI and understand what is this code doing.
And then, as we get through the next few modules, we'll start to change those and alter them and make them work for us and take some of those Lego blocks that we've been playing with for the first couple of modules here and start to put them together in different ways that actually help you do exactly
what you want to do. So I hope that's been useful. I'll see you in the next video. Bye for now.

## Module 3: Understanding Scripts

### Video 3-1: Understanding Scripts (21 min)

G'day, Mike again. Alright, and this module, we're gonna try and understand our scripts a little bit. Now this is completely optional, but I found that the, the more you understand it a domain, the better you are at pulling the right information out of an AI.
So just understanding a little bit about a script, what makes up a script, what the different parts of the script are, will help you have better conversations with an AI, help you prompt better, help you spot mistakes, better because AI is a long way from perfect, right?
And it will make mistakes. So we're going to jump into cursor, which I showed you in the last module, just because it's more colorful and it's easier to see the different areas of what's going on.
And I've loaded up all of the scripts from cs. Remember we covered that in the last video. You can grab those at ADagent.com slash cs.
I've just saved them all as just new file. So I just came into here, created a new file, named it, saved the code.
I put that .js on the end. That tells cursor, hey, this is a JavaScript file that we're working with. And so format it based on the fact that it's JavaScript.
If we don't have that and it thinks it's just a text file, then everything's going to be all one color, all in gray.
Not very exciting. Okay, not that scripts are that exciting. Okay, so first thing that we notice is that we have this constant spreadsheet URL.
So just like the practice scripts that we played with in the very first module, all of those from the scary challenge.
We have some sort of constant at the top here and we can put our URL in there and as you can see from the comment here these two slashes say this is a comment ignore everything after this please computer on this line.
We can either add in a sheet URL here or we can leave it blank and a new one will be created for us and of course we know how to find And that URL now we just need to look in the logs at the bottom of the screen in Google ads.
And then we have this function main. So all, let me make it a bit bigger for you. All Google ads scripts will have this function main at a minimum.
They have to have this main function. That's the thing that runs when we run a script, we run this main function.
And you can see I've got these little chevrons here in cursor. You won't find these if you're looking in Google ads and trying to edit code in Google ads, but I can fold up That main and I see that is Basically the entirety of this script.
We'll look at another one in a minute, which has different functions all the way through And that can be just very useful when you're Maybe writing or more likely editing code because you're probably going to use the AI to do most of the writing for you But then you might want to go in and just tweak
some things edit Double check what the AI is doing. Maybe that feels like a long way off at this point because you've never coded a thing totally fine.
But as you ask AI to do more and more of this, asking the AI to explain why it did something, asking it to explain a piece of code.
Grabbing someone else's script, one of mine or one that you find on LinkedIn, paste that in and say, hey, what does this script do?
Explain these sections to me. It can be a really useful thing to do. And so the main thing I want to point out here is that we have a bunch of comments in the code.
So again, if you're trying to learn how to code, these can be really useful. And you can ask the AI to write these for you.
So whether it does it automatically the first time, or not, you could just come into here. Remember, this is the AI is built into cursor.
So we're not having to copy and paste all of this out to chat GBT, do something with it and bring it back.
I've got GPT-running inside cursor here, and I could just simply say add more comments to the code. It helps us to read the code and to understand the code, very, very useful if you're ever going to collaborate with somebody on one of your scripts.
Maybe you work at a large agency and you've got lots of people that would love to be able to use these scripts but they want to change it a little bit for them.
Having comments throughout the code helps everybody in that situation. But of course, it also helps the AI to understand the code itself so that when you're asking the AI to make changes to your code, it's better able to make changes because it's reading this through as language.
It's not but it's not trying to interpret this. It's literally acting like a code would do and sitting here kind of reading through from top to bottom and the more you can do to help the AI understand your code, the better that's probably going to be.
Now I rather stupidly here have sent this off on a little later and now and it's making changes to all four of the scripts.
So it might take a little bit longer than I was planning on, but we'll let that run. So comments are really good to understand code, both for you and for the AI.
Now the other big thing that you can use are those logs. And we'll talk more about this in the debugging module.
But we can ask the AI to add more logs. So that's lines that look like this logger.log or console.log. These are the little messages that get shown to us, the user, in that screen down the bottom of Google ads.
And they help us see what's happening and see what's going on. But when we're trying to fix errors, adding more logs to the script is really, really useful for the AI to understand what happened when we run this script.
Oh, wow. Okay. So it's added lots and lots and lots of comments here. I might just stop that where it is.
And I'll keep those changes that I can always undo them later. So it's added this big comment at the top here with the purpose and the setup and the notes And then saying like okay, this is the entry point And that's pretty much what it's done.
If we had more functions It would have added a comment at the top of each function explaining what each function does That's you may have heard this term functional programming That's essentially one of these you you break a problem down you break your code down into the sort of It's not the smallest
possible steps, but into small chunks. And then each chunk does one thing well, kind of like a good landing page, right?
Each function does one thing well, and then the functions talk to each other and pass information backwards and forwards so that you're not sort of lumping all of this logic into one place and asking something to do too much.
It's easier for us to understand that way, or this function does this one thing, it's easier for the AI to understand as well.
And then just a couple of little things that I'll point out through here that will be useful and completely optional, but useful to know, good little tricks.
What we're doing here is we've got this try, try basically we're saying try doing all of this. And if it doesn't work, then catch the error.
So that rather than just an error happening and the screen stops, the script stops running and it can't do anything else and you just get this error message, instead it sort of fails more gracefully, if you like.
And then says, oh, hey, I got this error over here. In this particular situation, it's not gonna make a lot of difference.
But many times you can do this in such a way such that the script keeps running. So it's trying to do something if it doesn't work.
Hey, not a problem. I'll show this error message to the user and then try it and keep going. So rather than just falling over and failing.
We also have in here some conditional logic. Maybe you've used conditional formatting in a Google sheet before. If this, then that.
If this thing is in a cell, then make it bright red. Well, this is the same sort of thing here.
We have this little if statement saying if there is no spreadsheet, then do this thing. In other words, build a new spreadsheet until the user what the new spreadsheet is.
or keep going with the one that the user has provided. And then we're clearing out the sheet, getting rid of any old data, building our headers in here, sticking those at the top of the sheet.
And then comes the bit where we're actually trying to get some data out of Google ads. And that formatting seems to have got a bit messed up.
Never mind. Can't help myself. off. That's better. So what we're doing here. I made a video on SQL because SQL is one of those kind of scary looking things but it really isn't that bad.
There's basically just three words that you need to know. Select from and where. And this is, you do this all the time.
When you open up Google ads, you look at, you pick, first of all, which thing I want to look at, am I looking at campaigns, which is what we're looking at here, from campaign, am I looking at keywords, am I looking at ads?
So what you do first is figure out where you want to look at data from. In this case, from campaign.
So this is exactly the same as going into the interface and going campaigns, campaigns, campaigns, because we have click it three times now and choosing the campaign data.
Then select is basically like let's choose the columns that I want to see in the table in front of me so I want date, campaign name and then a few metrics.
And I always get these five pretty much as a minimum every single time because from these five I can calculate basically everything else that I need.
Click through rate, conversion rate, average order value row as CPA. I can figure out all of those from these five metrics.
The only other two you might particularly want are all conversions and all conversion value. If you're doing something with secondary conversions at a campaign level, you might want impression share metrics.
I'll show you in a later video where you can find the list of all of the metrics that are are available for each thing that you want data for.
So in this case, the thing is campaigns. We're going to collect these columns, this data, and then we have a bit of a condition at the bottom here.
And again, this is exactly like in Google Ads, where you choose the date range. And you choose those dropdowns saying, do I want all campaigns do I want, or active and paused, or enabled and paused or do I want just enabled?
And here we're just saying, yeah, I just want the enabled ones, please. And I want the last days. Now again, there are things that you can say in here and things that you can't.
The AI will often try and write last days. That doesn't exist. There is no thing that you can put in here saying last days, you can calculate a little sentence for the code that basically says from this date to this date.
I'll show you that later about how you can, I'll give you a little function later on that you pass in a number like and it spits back the little sentence that you need.
But otherwise you can use last days, last seven days, yesterday, those will be the common ones that you use, but just know that last days does not exist, you have to create that little sentence.
And then just to finish off here, what this is then doing. So we're creating this query. So this is a SQL query and we're saying go collect this data from this place with this criteria please.
And it does that and it goes and grabs a whole bunch of rows. And then we're saying right, while you still have rows start at the top and while you still have rows please work through each row.
And so it's going and grabbing the little bits of information from here it's going and grabbing the date from this first row and then the campaign name and then this and it's basically creating like a little row of its own data so it's taking the stuff out of Google and it's turning it into something
that it can work with and while it's doing that sometimes we'll transform data while we're grabbing it and so cost rather confusingly in the Google system is in millions of a dollars but millions of a thing, millions of a euro, millions of a pound.
Try saying that three times quickly. Millions of a dollar in my case. And so it's called cost micros. So maybe you've run a script before you pulled some data and you go, whoa, I am not spending million dollars.
Ah, okay, it's actually dollars. Got it. But it's actually dollars. Got it. But it's presented with basically six decimal places. So one million equals one dollar.
And so we have to divide by a million to get it back to the regular number that we're used to seeing.
Bazaarly, conversion value is not in micros. So you don't need to divide that one by a billion, but this will catch people out sometimes.
So if you're trying to figure out CPC and you end up seeing a CPC of two million, that's okay. Just remember you have to tell the AI, no, we need to divide this number by a million because it's in micros.
That's the technical. term. So we're doing that, and then we're just looping through all of our rows, and we're building this little thing called data.
It's technically called an array, but it doesn't matter, we can just call it a thing. Then when we get to the end, if our thing actually has something in it, if it's longer than zero, then go stick that into the Google sheet as well, please.
So we've already put our headers in up here. That's what this did. We are setting the values of row one was saying stick these things and we've defined headers here and then we're saying stick all of that in row one please.
Now loop through until you haven't got anywhere else to go and then assuming that you've got some data then stick that in the spreadsheet starting on row two stick that underneath the headers and then send a little message to the user saying, awesome, I have sent this many rows off to the Google sheet
. And then if there's no spreadsheet, then send another message saying, I haven't got a spreadsheet and I've created this, otherwise we're all good.
And then if there are any errors, show the error message to the user and then stop. So that's the basic concept here.
Again, you don't need to know it in any great detail. But the more you get familiar with the layout, with the concepts, I've just knowing what's possible.
Knowing, for instance, that we could, I mean the glasses for this one, we could format this data in the sheet.
Now, every time we have a chat to a spreadsheet, every time we use this set values or talk to spreadsheets, so here we're clearing the data, so that's one, here we're writing the headers, that's two, and down here we're doing this in one big lump, we're collecting all the data, and we're sending all 
of that data in one big lump. Sometimes the AI will do this row by row, so it'll read a row of data and then try and send that row of data off to the sheet, and then come back and read another row, and then send another row after that's incredibly inefficient because every time we chat to the sheet, 
it just takes time. And remember, we have this -minute time limit with scripts that we cannot go past, so we have to be efficient where we can be, and doing all of this in one big lump is a better way to do it.
But having sent all of that data, what we could do is we could, let's say, um, make a bit of room here, we could bold the first row, you've got a few options for doing that because we're in cursor here, we can tell it to do things and it'll just magically do it.
So one way you could do that would be to write a comment. And if we say, bold, the header row, and when I hit enter down to the next line, it understands what it is that I want.
And all I've got to do is hit the tab key and that line of code has been written for me.
And it's basically saying go to the sheet, get that first row and set it to bold. Now, what if we want to do something a bit more complicated?
What if we want to format this? While we've got impressions and clicks, they're probably going to be integers. But these numbers are all going to have loads of decimal places.
So what if we didn't want that? Let's just say, actually, I'm going to record it, because I barely type anything anymore.
I tend to just use, I use a tool called Whisperflow, we'll talk about that later, go to roads.ai. If you want to get $worth of credits for that, but I tend to use Whisperflow for everything now, so format, cost, conversions, and conversion value to two decimal places.
Now, I'm doing that, as I comment, you can see I haven't even hit Enter yet, and it's already writing it for me.
And again, I'm just going to hit tab. And because those three columns are together, it's able to do it in again, one big lump.
It's basically saying start here and carry on for three columns. And all of those numbers, let's format that to two decimal places.
Because I've got AI in here, I could also do that in here. So let's be lazy and copy my comment and delete that and come over to here, start a new chat with the AI, paste that in and see what it does.
Now I'm using GPT-so it's going to have a bit of a think, it's going to plan, it's going to reason, it's going to write itself a little to do list, maybe, oh God.
And it's going to do it for all four scripts, which is not what I want, so I'm going to stop that in and then I can add the particular file that I want it to work with so where are we for CS chart this so I'm gonna say just in this particular file please format these three things to two decimal places
and hopefully it'll put something similar in down here it might even write the comment for us it might put it further down, we'll see.
But we can use the AI, so rather than copying all of this over to chat GPT and then writing what you want and then fiddly copying and pasting and bringing that back, or usually what you would do at that point, you wouldn't be using Curse, so you'd be pasting that straight into Google ads.
And then if there's a problem, you gotta go back to the AI, you've got to sometimes it won't even write the full script for you.
It'll just say, hey, on this line, find this and change it to that. And that's a real pain to do.
And it takes my longer versus just doing the whole thing in here. So it said it's done everything. I'm just going to believe it.
I'm going to keep. And the reason I'm just believing it is because when we run the code, we'll find out if it runs or it doesn't.
But we'll cover that in a video in a moment of how to deal with those errors that come up because code has got this wonderful quality.
I need it runs or it doesn't, and if it doesn't run, we're going to get some sort of error message from somewhere.
We tell the AI what the error is and we ask the AI to fix the code for us and that will usually do a very, very good job of that.
All right, that's it for this one. So that was an overview of scripts in the next one. Let's talk about error messages and how to deal with errors.

## Module 4: Create with Scripts

### Video 4-1: Create with Scripts (11 min)

Hey, welcome back. In this video, I want to talk about writing scripts using AI. Obviously the whole point of this workshop is to not try and learn JavaScript from scratch, but to use AI to help write our scripts.
Now that doesn't mean that all of the thinking gets abdicated to the AI. It's on you to still figure out what you want the script to do, what data you want it to collect.
and probably a little bit of what do you want to do with that data. The simplest form of script is just to log that data to the screen, to show that data on the screen, but that's probably not reusable.
You probably don't just want to read it on the screen. You probably want to do something with it. And so generally putting that data into a Google sheet is usually the next step.
Now you've been through the previous videos, you've gone through the script challenge, you understand the benefits of all of that.
So our very simple script, we could maybe ask the AI to write a very simple Google ads script that collects search term data for the past seven days and outputs that to a Google sheet.
And let's see how it does with a very simple prompt like that. Now, AI has improved massively over the last months.
By the way, this setup here is an artifact in Claude.ai. So usually when Claude is writing code, it does this split screen approach, which I really, really like.
You may need to just turn this on though in your settings. So just maybe in settings down here, just scroll down.
Oh, they've moved it, I guess. Oh, well, I guess it's built in now. It used to be under Profile, used to have to scroll down and find a little setting here to turn, there you go, to turn that on.
You apparently don't anymore. So ignore me, let's just go back to that. All right, so, click on the artifact and we get the code again.
So at its very simplest, that will often get things right. In this particular case, it hasn't, how do I know that just by looking at it?
You see this section, we didn't really go too deep into the whole sequel thing but you'll remember select from where, from one of the earlier videos.
This from line is all in capitals. So I know that this is the old version of Google Scripts. Google updated everything about two, three years ago.
So the problem is that the vast majority of examples that the AI has seen in its training data are the old versions of scripts.
And so it'll often do something like this and create an old version, which is perfect, perfect because I've got the solution coming in a couple of videos time.
My mega prompt is a big long prompt that we feed into the AI with loads of different examples built in to ensure that it doesn't do this exact thing is the crazy thing that will often work because Google are quite clever and they've made sure their scripts still work even for the old versions but for
how long we don't know they may kill that off one day but for the most part it'll probably be okay it'll probably work but there's a few things that we could improve here.
So you will have noticed before that one of the patterns I really like is if the user forgets to enter a sheet URL at the top that we create a script for the user as a sheet sorry for the user and then show them the URL of that new sheet in the locks.
Now that obviously isn't going to happen by standard. We would have to ask for that and we can do that.
We can prompt If the user forgets to enter a sheet URL, then create a sheet for them and show them the URL in a console log.
Also, make sure that that sheet URL variable starts with just the two single quotes at the top, so that it's blank and easier for the user to paste in their sheet URL once they have one.
Because otherwise to use this, we've got to go in here, get our cursor into the right place, highlight the right thing, delete that, and then paste Rin.
I prefer it to start like that. But you'll notice that it made changes. We're now looking at version two up here.
We can go back and find version one if we want. You can also, if you think it doesn't give you the right thing, you can just have it retry and either just quickly do a retry or have it think a little bit longer and then have another crack at it.
So if the code you get for some reason you really don't like or it doesn't work, you can ask it to go again.
But of course usually we won't know that just by looking at it. What we're going to do is copy that and go chuck it into an account here and then we'll see if it runs or not.
That's the wonderful thing about code and why AI is getting so good at code is because it either runs or it doesn't and if it doesn't then we get the error back to AI and we just go round and around.
So sorry what I did very quickly there was just highlight the existing script and then just paste the new one over the top.
Let me slow that down. Highlight everything that's there and hit delete, copy the code from the AI and paste that in.
But if you highlight everything and paste over the top, then your new script is there. Now, we don't have that, so hopefully we'll create a new script for us.
Again, I'm going to hit Preview and then change to View the logs in here so that I can see what's happening while the script is running.
Wonderful. This is great. We got an error. So it did create the sheet for us. So what I might do, oh, no, I won't copy that because I've got an error.
So, what I really care about at this point is not what's on the sheet, but why did I get an error?
So, what we would do at this point, thank you for messing up AI, is we're just going to copy that error, go back into here and say something like, got error.
And we don't even have to say please fix, but, you know, for the sake of that, why not? Please fix.
And it will go, oh yes of course, I forgot this thing and we need to do this and this is what we need to do differently.
But you can see this sort of takes a little bit of time. So in a minute, we're going to do the same sort of thing in cursor and it's easier to make edits to existing code.
This is a short script, and it's fairly easy for the AI just to go in and edit this artifact and create the new code.
But sometimes it can get a bit confused, especially with longer scripts. and sometimes it just takes a long time to edit in this UI, whereas editing in cursor is much, much faster.
But let's now take this code, come in here, highlight everything, and let's go again. And it should just take a few seconds because we're not asking for much data.
What I probably should have done is instead of saying all search terms in the last seven days, I could have said where impressions are greater than that would have been a little bit faster to run Just while we're testing, but it only took seconds We've got rows and now if I take that URL
Open that in a new tab Perfect, we see all the search terms And impressions clicks cost click through rate and cpc So now we can iterate so instead of trying to get everything perfect on the first attempt what we might now do is iterate because I don't really care about click-through rate and CBC yet
. What I usually do is I get five metrics impressions, clicks, cost, conversions, and conversion value. And from those five things, I can calculate everything else.
I can either calculate that in a sheet or I can get the script to do that for me, which is usually easier because we're not riding the code.
We might as well have the AI do that for us So then we would just simply go back and say Let's add conversion and conversion value also add average order value return on ads bend CPA and conversion rate So those are the five Metrics that I always use and then those same six derived metrics that you can
get from those first five and we'll see how it does it, even though it's using the old version of scripts, that hasn't mattered here, it has been able to go and get that data, it was still able to run quickly, it did what we wanted, it created the URL and logged that, there you go.
That has now finished, now we're up to version we can still see all of the old versions in there, but let's just take this, chuck it in here and get rid of that.
Now, what I will do this time is because it's already created a sheet for me, I will take that sheet URL and paste it in at the top of my script just so it doesn't keep creating a new sheet every time and fill up my Google Drive with a whole bunch of sheets that some point in the future I'm going to 
have to go back and delete. I didn't ask it to do Impression is greater than so we're just going to have to wait a little bit longer for it to do all of that.
It'll take a little bit longer this time because we're pulling a bit more data, but only a couple of seconds.
And this time it didn't log the URL because it knows that we already put that in, and therefore we already know, and there we go.
Perfect. Now, the only other thing I would typically do at this point is I would have it sort that data and typically I'll sort by impressions high to low or maybe cost high to low just to keep things tidy in here but we can worry about that another time.
So that's a very very simple hey please can you create this script for me we had a couple of errors which is perfect in the next video we'll go into how we can minimize those errors and help the AI give us better output sooner.
I'll see you in the next video.

### Video 4-2: Create with Scripts (7 min)

One of the ways we can get AI to make less mistakes is to give it access to documentation. In this case, the Google Script API documentation.
So you can see here, I have pasted in the error that I got with the previous script. And then I've said down here, please read this.
I'll show you that website in just a second. And then I've used a special keyword that Claude reserves, which is think hard.
So you can use think hard, think harder, think hardest or ultra think, and that assigns more tokens to the AI's thinking period, which is sort of how long it thinks about stuff before it answers you.
So in this case, I've said think hard. So it's gone off, read that documentation and then corrected the script. And then I did say this time, sort by impressions descending.
And now it's given me this new script. I also added that impressions greater than and now it has output my search terms sorted with the right data.
Now the documentation is from this website so if you search for developers.google.com and then or if you just search Google dev API scripts, something like that you'll find this.
I'll also paste this URL next to the video on my circle on my site with this course material. So this is fantastic.
I use this all the time. Back in the day, two, three years ago, whenever I first did scripts and sheets mastery, we would spend about an hour going through all of this to understand in great detail the documentation.
But you don't need to do that. All you need to do is to know that it is here. So we were doing a script just before for search terms.
So if we come into here, you'll see. So the latest version is version of the API. They change every four months or so ish.
And there are two main types of resource, types of thing that we want to fetch. There are things with metrics and things without metrics.
Most of the time you're probably beginning things with metrics, at least for now. So ad groups, you can see in here, asset groups.
We were doing search terms, so I just scroll down here until I find something that looks right search term view Who knows but probably seems about right and then if we want we can come into here and read through all of this and try and Understand what all of this means or we can just Give this URL to
our favorite AI and say hey, please read this I think it'll help you improve the script and that's exactly what I did You could, if you wanted to, come into here and you can build your own query, that SQL thing that we talked about before, select from where we can build this in here.
This is what we used to do two, three years ago. I'd come into here and I'd find all of the stuff in here that I actually want, my actual search term, and then the metrics around that, maybe I wanted cost and clicks.
and both impressions gone. It'll be sort of an alpha-order bike, right? And then this is filling out all of this stuff for me and then I could copy that and go paste it into the AI and say, hey, build a script for me using this query, using this SQL.
But the AI is way smarter than it was a couple years ago. So instead of doing this, all we really need to do is to give it the URL of that previous page, this search term view page, have it read the documentation, and that will cause it to give us much, much better scripts first time.
My last little note on the resources without metrics, you might be thinking what on earth doesn't have a metric. Well, there are lots of things in here, so assets, for example, if you want to get a report about all of your ads, ads are made up of individual assets.
And all of the interesting detail about an asset is held in here. So, for example, if I scroll down to the text area, you can see that we've got text asset text, or we've got site link details, the actual description, the actual text itself of the site link.
We've got mobile apps, we've got lead forms. The image assets, the URL of the image, the height, the width, the type of image asset.
All of that is held in here, and all of that gets tied to an asset ID. Hmm, okay. So if I wanna pull a report about assets, I need to do two things.
I need to go up to the resources with metrics and figure out which of these various asset reports I need, do I need asset groups, do I need asset group product groups, do I need asset field types, I don't know, I would probably give all of those if I didn't know to the AI and say, hey, you figure it 
out because if it's a search campaign, it's going to be this thing. Add group, add asset view. If it's PMACs, then there'll be some stuff in asset groups.
If it's shopping, it's probably going to be a group. But you can give a bunch of URLs to the AI and say, hey, I don't know, it's in there somewhere, you figure it out.
The bit with the metrics is in So it's really weird, but I can understand it being a geek. I can understand why they do this, but if you're new to this it can be bloody confusing because in here you're going to get basically an ID and some metrics that go along with that asset ID.
But if you want all of the detail about what that asset actually entails or the text that goes along with that asset, then that's all going to be hiding in this asset resource without metrics.
So it's pretty confusing the first time you look at this. We're not quite at the point where you can say, hey, AI, just go to this overview page, visit here and visit all of the pages that are linked off here, please go read all pages in the documentation.
We're not quite at that stage with AI yet, probably not far off. But for now, find the page that looks vaguely connected to the thing that you want, tell it to read that and any other related pages and that will usually get you most of the way I'll see you in the next video.

### Video 4-3: Create with Scripts (18 min)

Welcome back. So, in this video I want to talk about the different AI models you can use and some of the pros and cons of each of those.
So if we dive back into our search term script that we created in the last video, I got up to version here.
Um, if I make changes as you saw before, the artifact, this thing over here on the right hand side, tries to, it tries to edit that artifact.
It tries to sort of rather than write the whole script again from scratch, it tries to edit what's already there.
Chaggity is going to do a similar thing, so if we say create a simple Google ad script to get search terms for the past seven days, only get those that have at least impressions.
use version of the API. Send the data to a Google ads, sorry, to a Google sheet. Have a sheet URL constant at the top of the script if the user doesn't enter a URL, create a sheet for them, and log the URL to the console, otherwise use the sheet provided by the user.
the last thing. Sort the data by impressions high to low before sending the data to the sheet. So let's see what GBDthinking comes up with.
Now, I had it set to five thinking from a previous use of GPT-You could quite easily use GPT-as well.
The benefit of GPT-being, it tries to decide how much thinking to do based on what you have asked for.
Depending on the complexity of what you're asking for, GPT-instead of having to use all of the different models that you had to choose between, GPT-does that smart routing for you and tries to figure out which version behind the scenes to send the code too.
So we'll see what that comes up with. Meanwhile, what I've done is taken this script from Claude and pasted it into cursor that we were using earlier if you remember.
Because what I prefer to do now is to have the AI I'll just create a new window in a new chat over here.
Rather than copy and paste and wait for those edits, I prefer to bring everything in cursor because I have my library of all of my scripts saved over here.
And I'm gonna show you at the end of the workshop how to get a copy of all of these scripts by just pasting in a line of code into cursor.
So you can get to copy all of these a rather than copy and paste them individually one by one from the place where I storm the code for this course, you'll be able to copy the whole lot in one go.
And then in here, I can have a chat with the AI based upon what we are looking at. So because I've got this tab open, it's automatically added it to my chat.
It knows what I'm talking about. So if I say change this so that we are getting search terms with more than impressions in the last days and hit go.
So I'm expecting it to make changes down here, but I can see the changes that it makes. So I'll be able to see which lines it's deleting, which lines it's adding, or which lines it's changing.
And I can prefer being able to keep an eye on what it's doing. So there we go. You can see it's greater than last days.
It looks like that's the only changes that it made or there's another change all the way down here. Let's scroll down.
Here we go. Nice. So it does the little things like that. So no search term data found for the past days rather than the past seven days.
Lovely. And then if I want to keep those changes, I can just say keep. There we go. Okay, now let's try something a little harder for the AI.
Let's ask it to grab three different types of data and put that data into three different tabs in our sheet, so now I want you to change the script and have three additional variables at the top of the script.
For three different tabs, we're going to have a campaigns tab, keywords and search terms. Use lowercase names for the tabs with no spaces.
So for the campaigns, I want you to get all campaign data from enabled campaigns for the last days. For the keywords, I want you to get all keyword data for all keywords that have any impressions at all in the last days even if they've since been paused and then for search terms we'll keep that
as it is impressions greater than for the last days and I want obviously the data from each of those three resources to go to the appropriate tab.
So I'm again using whisper flow to dictate all of this I just find I can get more context out faster by dictating rather than typing so we'll hit go on there.
Now, I know what you might be thinking. I wouldn't know to ask for that. I don't know that I want tab names at the top of the script.
I don't know that I want them in lowercase yet. Why do you want them in lowercase? So that's just my preferences that have built up over time.
So the more you do this, the more scripts you create by talking to your computer, the more you kind of learn the little things that you like it to do, that maybe it doesn't do out of the box, it doesn't do by standard.
And so I've just learned how I like to do those things and learned how to talk to the AI. Now what I should have done before starting any of this, which was really daft of me, what I should have done is copy and paste this file.
So I should have created a new copy of that file, called it version two, and then asked the AI to work on version two so that I could give you at the end of this when I give you all of the code, I could give you this as well as the original so that you can compare and contrast those two.
They can see it, did that pretty quickly. It's telling me over the side here, all the things it's done, but critically compared to this interface back in Claude, I can see what's happening.
So, I could and how I started and if you want to learn any JavaScript at all, if you want to improve your knowledge over JavaScript about JavaScript, I would recommend reading through these changes, trying to understand what it is the AI is doing and go through and say, yep, okay, I'll keep that.
That may seem like a long way off at this point, but the more you do it, the more things you'll pick up and the more you'll learn.
So you can learn a great deal instead of the way I learned the code way back in the day where I would learn about if statements and variables and loops and having to learn the basic sort of theory of coding and that sometimes goes on for like six months before you actually get to do anything interesting
whereas here we're flipping it we're creating the interesting thing we're having the AI write the code and then we can learn by going through that code and understanding what it does to speed things up.
I'm just going to say keep everything. But if I wanted to, I could highlight a little bit of code here.
And then copy that over to the side here and say explain this bit. If you want to learn, this is a great way to understand what's going on.
And then it just tells you in simple language what this power code does. And if that really doesn't make sense, you can say, explain it like I'm five, ELI five.
And so it'll use even simpler language. So that little cheat code ELI five or ELI or whatever number you want, it understands, oh, okay.
You want me to explain this to you like you're a five year old. And so you can see pause the video if you want.
It's basically turned all of that into toy collections and sock drawers. Okay. So that's high search terms. Now what I will do is rename this Vand I will quickly copy and paste that and go back to my original and we'll copy the code from Claude and throw that into the original one here.
Okay, so it doesn't have my URL in, which is great, but that was the original. And then let's also create another file in here, search terms chatgpt.
Now I always put the .js on the end. That tells cursor that this is a JavaScript file, which just helps with the formatting of that.
And so we'll come over to here now and grab, before I forget, grab all of that code from gbtand paste that into here.
Number of funky little things in here. Now we should probably check before I give you a copy of this code.
We should probably check that this one actually works. So let's go in and see if that works. And see if we get any errors on this one.
Again, we've got a blank optional sheet, which is fantastic. great we've got an error so we can now take that error and we can do a couple of things we could either because we've now got that code in cursor we could try and fix it here and or we could go back over to here and just say error whoops I 
hit Enter too early for that time if you want to create a blank line obviously I'm getting you know this already, but just hit shift enter.
I messed up and didn't press shift enter, so I'm just going to come out of that and hit go. In cursor, I'm going to have cursor see if it can fix that error as well.
But rather than have it sort of get stuck in this, explain it like I'm five mentality, I don't want it to try and fix the script following on from that.
I want to clean that out, start a new chat. So just like we would in, say, Claude, we would come over and hit the new chat button.
The way we do that in cursor is to click this little plus sign at the top of the AI agent section.
And that starts a new chat. You can see my old chats across the top here. And I can say error.
What was the error I got? Copy that error back into here. again you could say please fix these days AI is smart enough to be able to figure out I probably don't even need to type no I don't need to type error colon above that if I just paste the error message in it's usually gonna get it correct but 
it is important rather than just try and figure out which bit of this maybe it needs like maybe we could just get away with telling it that or reading the error message using our dictation app.
Usually with Google ads scripts because they're all text logs. The easiest thing to do is copy and paste all of the logs, paste it back.
Excuse me, into the AI and see what it is able to do. So it's made the changes already. We'll say keep that and we'll test that.
So you've probably heard the phrase writing is editing. Coding is debugging, even when you're using an AI. So it's good that we're getting a couple of errors here, so you can see exactly how I do it, which is throw the error in, ask it to change the code, go back over to Google ads, highlight all that
, delete it, paste it in, and hit preview again. So we just go around this loop two or three times. Usually that is all it takes.
If you find yourself going around the loop five or six times, it's probably a more serious error. At that case, just abandon it and start again, but there you go.
It fixed it first time. We've got rows. Now, let's see if JGBT was able to solve this. So it had a little think here.
And this is the difference with OpenAI. It then writes out all that code again. And again, for a short little script like this, it's not a problem.
But later on, when your script start getting longer and longer and longer. It is a real pain to have to wait for the AI to write out a thousand lines of code or what it will do is just give you a little snippet and I will say, hey, find function main blah blah blah blah, find this thing in your code 
and take this and remove that and put this bit in instead. And that is quite painful to do, especially if you're only writing code in the Google ads interface, trying to find, see, we can't fold up this code, we can't easily search through this code for a particular thing.
If I search for in it, it may be highlighted, but it often won't take me directly to that, some things it will and some things it won't.
It's just painful to edit inside of here. Whereas doing all of that inside of a tool like cursor just makes life much much easier.
Plus, we have a record of all of our scripts as we go. So we've got all the different versions. This is why the PMAC script is up to version at the time of recording because this is exactly how I did it.
I would come in for the next day and the new ideas I had, I would come into version two copy and paste.
So I'm literally just Command C, Command V. Rename that Vcopy to VStart a new conversation. And then ask for the changes that I wanted to V
Go around a couple of times, fix things, maybe tweak something in the sheet. And then I'd have VAnd then the next bunch of changes, VV
And so I use that naming convention all the time in cursor. It's a really handy way just to keep all of the different versions and play with those.
So let's just see, just for the sake of completeness, if ChatGbT was able to solve this. So I'm expecting rows of data if it's fixed it the same way that cursor did.
And if we get something vastly different, then we know we've got two very different things. Oh, this one isn't going to tell us how many rows, but let's just quickly edit that, open that sheet in a different tab here, write, no data.
So chat GBD has failed miserably at this point. I'm kind of not surprised by that. Now I'm not going to go round and round around trying to fix this error at this point, but let's just, let's get rid of V
We don't need that. Let's find, so that was this one. So I should, actually, but let's not save that. I don't want to confuse you by giving you code that doesn't work, but let's check that this Vcode does work, because I'm assuming that it does, but we'd never actually checked that.
We did get logs, so it looked like something ran, but we never actually went to the sheet and visually confirmed that we had the data in there, which is a useful pattern to get into.
I mean usually I would do that and it does look like it's writing data to different tabs and so on, so it's probably correct, but it is always a good idea just to, especially if you want to then go do something with the data, just visually confirm that you have got data in all the right places.
So there we go. Curse that one, and got everything right first time. Thank you, Curse. So I think Curse is a better place to create code, but again, if you're just going to copy and paste someone else's scripts, and that's good enough for you and maybe occasionally make a tiny edit, then claw.ai
, maybe chat GBT will be good enough. You don't need certainly don't need to spend money on cursor. $a month for the pro plan.
For me, it's a huge bargain, but if you're only spending five minutes a week on scripts, please don't spend the money on cursor.
You could just as easily save all of your scripts in Google Drive or Dropbox or whatever it is that you use personally.
I spend a lot of time playing with scripts and automation so for me it's really handy to have it in here and to have my library of scripts to have all of the code in the middle here and then have AI right in here so that everything is in the same place and all together and I can choose to use different
models if I want I can use GPT-called Gemini Pro, I get to choose which AI I want to use if I care that much you might pay a little bit more that way.
If you leave it on auto, you know you're only going to spend bucks a month. In the next video, we'll talk a bit more about debugging code and error tracking.
I'll see you there. Bye.

### Video 4-4: Dealing with Scripts (24 min)

Welcome back. In this module we're going to talk about how to deal with errors in Google ads scripts. Now the wonderful thing about Google ads scripts is that we have these logs down at the bottom and the logs are all in text.
So it makes it very, very easy to just copy and paste even if they're quite long. Makes it very easy just to copy and paste these and then feed it back into the AI.
So, what I've done to kick us off here is I've taken the script that we were using last time. I've just cleared out those long logs at the top just so that we can see the data more clearly.
I've kept the bit of formatting that the AI created for us, haven't actually tested it yet. And I've taken that whole script with this blank spreadsheet URL at the top and I have I've pasted that directly into my Google ads test account here and hit preview and then moved from changes across to logs 
so I can read the logs. And it's told us that it's created a new sheet for us. So what I'm going to do is copy that URL and then I'm going to put it into here just so that we're using the same sheet each time from here on, I'm also going to jump back into cursor quickly and paste it in there so that 
when I copy and paste the script from cursor next time that is already done for me and remember we can't run Google ads scripts from cursor.
It's a wonderful place to do these three things to store all of our scripts to make changes to them and to have a conversation with the AI and write scripts, build them, change them, tweak them But we can't run scripts from here.
So we have to go back into Google ads in order to run the scripts So now that we've put the URL back into both places That's also pasted into a new tab so that we can see that sheet and indeed we have got the formatted first row And we've got these three columns with two decimal places exactly what we
asked for fantastic Okay, so now let's create some errors on purpose So a very common one, let's do this one first.
A very common one is that people will try and delete all of the gobbledygook at the end of the script, but they'll accidentally also delete that trailing slash.
Remember in one of the earlier videos, I said how important it was not to do that. Well, let's try that.
Let's just try copying that script as it is now, back into here. Remember, we're just going to delete all of the code that was there before, paste that in and hit go.
Now we should get an error message. Some confusing gobbledygook about how the sheet isn't viewable. We couldn't open the spread sheet at this address.
So what we can do is we can just take all of this, including the timestamps, doesn't matter, AI will figure it out.
We copy that to the clipboard, jump back into cursor, and I will typically say something like got this error, please fix.
That's pretty bad to all you're going to need. Most of the time that's going to be enough because we also have, and you can see it's got this one tab here.
We've got this active tab. It knows in cursor that we are talking about this particular script, but just to be really clear what I might do is add that file again because last time it wanted to change all of our files so I'm being very clear that it's this particular script that we're interested in.
I'm just going to zoom out a little bit here so we've got a bit more room to be able to see the script and more of the AI message which we just can't see when we zoomed in that much hopefully you can see this on whatever device you are looking at this video on and then we'll see what it says.
I may switch to a different model in a minute because GPT-is trying to figure out how much thinking is involved in order to answer this question, do I need a quick model or do I need to think a bit longer and do I need to analyze and think harder about a problem.
That's one of the benefits of GPT-which came out this morning. It is removing that complexity so that you don't have to try and figure out which of the different models available do I actually use, it will try and figure that out, but it is a bit slower.
So we might just move to, well, just for the sake of something different, we can move to GPT fast, but I'm much more familiar with Claude Sonnet, which is a good, pretty cheap, pretty fast and pretty decent model, especially for anything to do with code.
One of the other benefits of cursor here, we can choose from a whole bunch of models, we can add more, we can use the Google models, the open AI ones, Claude, as well as a whole raft of other models like DeepSeek and Quen and Grok and stacks of others.
So you get to choose your model. Oh wow, okay. It's got a little bit above and beyond here, which AI will often do, because it loves creating code for you.
So what it's doing now is it's basically running a test on the URL rather than just saying, hey, the URL's missing a slash on the end there.
Well, I suppose to be fair to the AI, it doesn't necessarily know that that ID in there is valid. It just knows that the sheet couldn't be opened.
But let's just keep all of the changes that it's suggesting. And just for fun, without even trying to read that, without trying to understand that, because most of the time I don't go and try, I just, this is how I validate the code that an AI writes.
I just paste it into Google and hit go and see what happens. Now, it's not going to work because I don't think it's going to magically add that trailing slash for us.
Oh my god, it did. I take it back. Okay, let's just double check that. Let's delete some of this data from the middle here and just make sure that it's not just making stuff up here.
We go back, bang. Okay, so what it did then with this wonderful little new function. Remember last video, I said we can have different functions and so it's created a new function here that goes in if there is an error so it changed something down here as well to say hey try and use this sheet but if
you get an error then go do something with this resolve spreadsheet ID function so go run this other function and do this with it whatever this means So let's take that and go this one, explain this code to me please, rather me try and explain it to you and show you how ignorant I am of JavaScript, let's
have the AI do that. All right so how does it work? Well it's first going to see if there's any input at all apparently and if there's no spreadsheet URL that throws an error and otherwise it's going to do this little rejects thing it looks like it looks for characters long, at least characters
long, and then probably tries a bunch of different ways to fix it. Ah, okay, right, so what it's doing is it's extracting the ID, so it's basically looking at this thing that was given to it, so then probably if we a loop.
But if, yeah, if I have, I don't know, so maybe doing that will work. If I give it docs.google.com, maybe somebody thought, oh, I don't need all of the HTTP rubbish on the end.
I just need to do this part, docs.google.com, it looks like it's looking for spreadsheets, D slash gobbledygook, and then turning it into the regular format, there's pretty clever.
We didn't ask it to do that, but it managed to do it. There you go. So it will take this raw ID.
Yeah, okay. So if I just give it the ID, then let's try that. Just give it the ID, and then I haven't deleted any of the code down the bottom here.
I just folded it up to make the script easier to read. And let's try running that and see if it works.
I'll delete all of that, throw that in and hit preview. So now I'm saying, hey, this is my spreadsheet URL.
No, it's not. And see if it can. Yep. It's figured out, okay, I reckon that gobbledygook is an ID. So I'm going to put it into the proper format for a spreadsheet.
And it has to make it work. I should. I had that to all of my scripts. And then I'll have less support to get to deal with.
That's fantastic. All right. So there we go. Other errors. Let's create some other errors now. Sometimes when the AI writes code for you, let's get rid of this for a second, it writes code for you.
Sometimes it gets most of the way there and then sometimes falls over just at the end. So maybe it's pretend that it's forgotten to add that last little curly bracket right at the end of our code there.
You can see it, it's desperate to jump in there and fix it for us, but we're not going to let it.
So we're going to say, let's copy all of this, we'll go back to Google ads, delete everything that we have so far, paste it all back in without the little curly bracket at the end and we're going to get a different error message down the bottom here.
So To run this in preview because we get to see what's happening and this time No, we didn't get any log messages because the script just wasn't able to run it didn't even get that far But it did give us this syntax error Now let's pretend that we haven't actually seen that we could just let's take a
screenshot of the whole page And I realized that you can't probably see me taking that screenshot, but take my word for it.
I took a screenshot of the whole page. I'm going to go back over to the AI and I'm going to start a new chat so it can't cheat and look at the previous one, a paste screenshot in.
And let's say I tried to run the script in Google ads, but it's just not running. I don't know why.
So we're not going to give it any hints this time. I'm not going to say hey there there was an error and we're going to see if it can figure out that there's this little syntax error unexpected input line 
Let's see what it can do with that. Screen shots can be really really useful because sometimes it's just easier to show a problem rather than trying to describe the problem to the AI.
I forgot to tell it which script we were actually working with because I started that new chat but it's figured out I've got this window open so I probably mean this one which is fantastic.
The main function was missing its closing brace on line and you can see it's added that curly bracket down the bottom here and now if I hit keep, of course we know this is going to work.
But anyway, we'll just paste the whole thing in. There's the missing curly bracket. And now it'll take a few seconds and it will run.
So it's really, really powerful. It's very, very hard to make a mistake. And there's really nothing to be afraid of.
You get some code. It's very, very rare that a script, a Google ads script certainly is going to suddenly delete swathes of your actual account.
Of course, if you're worried about that, you can always go and ask a different AI what's going to happen. I mean if you're really unsure of you don't know much about the place or the person that you've got this script from and you don't want to run it just yet you could do this in cursor but you could
also do it in here. I'm about to run this Google script I was given in my Google ads account, will it change anything in my account?
And then I usually put a little line of dashes and then paste the code in and hit go. And GPT-is going to tell me, I need to think a little longer because it's evaluating all of that code.
It's not running the code, it's not running it in your Google ads account, it's basically just kind of running it in its brain, sorry to like, promoteize or whatever that word is.
But here we go, short answer, I love that. Short answer, no, it won't change anything. And then it goes on to give us the long answer just in case we really want the long answer.
So there's very little downside to just experimenting with code. So you can come into cursor or your favorite AI if you really don't want to use cursor, ask it to write a script.
And that's what we'll cover in the next video, writing a script from scratch and then just running it and seeing if it works or not and if it doesn't work then we can add some error messages.
We can add some logs. That's another thing we haven't done here but we could say because it's such a short script it's actually going to be quite hard.
We can try. Let's try it. Add various debugging logs to the script so that you and I can find future errors more easily.
We'll throw that in, and now I would expect it to write more of these logger.log messages throughout the script. So often you'll use these to work out where you are in a script, because okay, I'm up to here, I'm up to here, I'm up to here, I can see the logs as I run through each section of the script
. And then when it falls over and you have an error, then you know, oh, it helps you identify which part of the script probably contains the error.
You can also do things like logging the value of variables. I haven't gone into variables yet because we're not trying to learn to code here.
But remember, even to start with this one, this is a type of variable. Spreadsheet URL is a thing. Think of it as a shoebox, as a bucket that holds some sort of value.
So this bucket holds this value mav blah blah blah blah blah. And so we can and it's actually done that for us.
It's logged at the top here. Hey, your URL is this. And if there's nothing in the bucket, this isn't or it says I'm either going to say to the user, hey, your bucket contains this or it'll say no your bucket's empty I'm going to create something for you.
So let's just again smash the keep all button and this time run this code. That's quite a bit longer now we've got lines instead of lines what I'm expecting to see are a bunch more logs now there we go.
So I'm starting your URL is this, you know it's only an ID but it doesn't matter. I'm going to open it.
I couldn't open it so I figured it out and I worked out that this was the ID lovely and I opened it successfully and I cleared it successfully, lovely and I'm going to set up some headers now for you and I did an on and on and on.
Probably a little bit too much but this This can be very, very useful, actually, I forgot to mention this. If you have it log, the first couple of rows of data, that can be hugely useful to help the AI understand the data that you're dealing with.
Right now, everything worked pretty well the first time. We could have tried this. We could have tried to get some data that just isn't possible.
Let's say, what would be a campaign thing that doesn't exist? Let's say campaign.budget. And I'll remember to put the comma on the end, so it doesn't throw a silly error.
But I'm asking for a thing that doesn't exist now. So now, if we were to run this, and this will happen often with AI, AI will write code for you to try and find data that doesn't exist.
Sorry, what I did there was just paste the new one over the top. So what I've been doing up until now is hitting command A, deleting everything, and then pasting in the new script.
What I did just then was just highlight everything, and rather than do, I just pasted the new one over the top marginally quicker and saves me just in case I'm a keyboard.
All right, so now if we run this we should get a different message and we can see look we're getting all of the logs that we got before.
This bit's working, this bit's working, I'm up to here. So now the machine is going to understand, hey, the error happened after all of this and this is the type of error that we got.
We got this unrecognized field campaign budget. Now again, it's a pretty short, simple script, it's only lines. My MCC pmax script just for comparison is about lines of code right now.
So lines is nothing into schema things very easy for the AI to understand what's going on. But let's do what we did before.
We're going to take this and rather than just copy this little error, if we take all of the logs that gives the AI a little bit more context, we have to see what's going on.
We'll flick back into here and we say, I've got this error, please fix, and then hopefully it will figure out that you probably, it will do one of two things, Italy, the work out that campaign budget doesn't exist and delete it, or it might try and invent a new campaign budget.
Now, it's figured out the invalid field, and I'm just going to delete that, which is why it's shown in red and when we say yes, keep this change, it's going to delete that line and now it should run absolutely fine because now we're back to the code that we had before and everything will just work.
One last one for you what I will do is say this okay those logs are pretty excessive and you're just spamming the console log now please add a switch right at the top of the script where I can say debug logs on or off or true or false, whatever I need to say, and so I can turn those logs on and off so
that I, once the script is working, I don't need to see all of those logs again, please. Now I hit go, so this can be very useful, right?
Maybe you want to see the logs and you want the AI to see the logs while you're working on your script.
But you don't want a user to then run your script and see all of this, all this stuff saying, I'm doing this now, I'm doing this.
Yes, I managed to do it. Okay, great, carry on. I'm now doing this. That gets a little bit annoying after a while, right?
It also slows things down because every time it has to write a new log, the script has to come out of what it's doing, come over to the screen, write something on the screen, go back to what it was doing.
and so that slows it down marginally. And so what it's done now is it's created this little thing at top again, let's just, oh, it's still going.
It's created this constant at the top here, debug logs equals false, set to true to enable detailed logging, perfect, exactly what we want.
And then it's gonna come through and it's just changing all of these logs to say, hey, debug log do this thing, debug log do this thing.
And they get this is calling a different function. So remember how we have these different functions, each function does a different thing.
It's added a little comment to our function so that we and the AI could understand what's going on here. I know it's a bit hard to see because it keeps changing, but this is basically saying, hey, every time, and now instead of just logging every time, every time I've got a message, I want you to go 
have a chat to the debug log function, and it will decide if we should show this message or not. And then debug simply says, hey, if debug logs is on, it's not.
If it's on, log the message, if it's not, just ignore it and carry on. So then it jumps straight back into the next part of the code and carries on.
So let's keep all of those. Let's keep that to false. Come back into here, I'll add everything, paste over the top.
Hit go. and because debugs are false, in other words off, we don't get all that crap. Now we change that to true and hit go again.
Now we should get all of the verbose explanation of what it's doing. So that can be a really useful trick for you to be able to debug things and then off the AI to be able to see everything and debug it.
And then once you're ready to go rather than have to go through and delete logs from your code before you share it with someone or before you sell it, you can just change that little setting and you good to go.
So that's error handling, logs, comments, in a nutshell, basically just get out there and try it. Go experiment. There's very little that can really go wrong.
Just try it. Get it to write some code, make sure it's not making changes to campaign. It's not going to go delete a campaign or delete a bunch of keywords.
I'll get to start with, and that's why we start with the four Cs. We start with checks and charting. We don't get to changes until later on.
So we're really comfortable with working in code. We're not trying to make changes to the account. Start with just checking for alerts and pulling data out into a Google Sheet so that we can go play in Google Sheets and go create charts, create tables and do all that fun stuff which we'll do in a module
very soon. Bye for now.

## Module 5: Google Sheet Formulas

### Video 5-1: Google Sheet Formulas (18 min)

Welcome back. In this module, we're gonna cover Google Sheets formulas. Now, how have we been doing this in the past?
We probably would have spent a couple of hours at this point learning about or different formulas and then practicing them over and over again.
Uh, I would have given you some sample Google Sheets and your homework would have been to use these formulas over and over again until it stuck in here.
But in a world of ubiquitous AI, I can't don't see the point of that. What I think is far more important is that you understand what's possible and understand that Lego block and then be able to ask an AI, hey, I've got this vague memory of this Lego block.
There's this query formula that I think would be really useful here. Please write the formula for me. Here's the detail that you need to understand.
and here's the context that you need in order to write the formula, go write it for me please. And with a short little formula, as you'll see, sometimes it's worth just knowing it and writing it yourself and not having to rush off to AI every single time.
But as your sheets get a bit more complicated as the formulas get more complicated, just asking AI to write it can be very, very easy.
And Google, depending on which version of Google sheets, you have depending on how much you're paying Google to access Google Sheets basically which tier of Google workspace you're in.
This may already be built into your Google Sheets, some of these formulas or the ability to ask AI to do stuff inside your sheet and remember today's the worst it's ever going to be.
So Google's ability to work inside your sheet is only going to get better and better as they integrate Gemini into sheets more and more.
But let's start by looking at just a few formula that understanding that these exist, just understanding what's possible makes life so much easier.
So I'm going to work through a little example here to demonstrate these seven things. We've got four formula query unique import range.
We'll use a separate example for that and array formula and then named ranges conditional formatting and data validation. So let's jump over to a Google sheet.
And this is the data that we were playing with from before, we've just got campaign data, we've got it split out by day, and then just those five metrics that we were pulling before.
Go away. Now query and unique first. So what I want to do is I want to create a new tab in my sheet here where I can choose a campaign from a drop down and then chart the cost by day.
So the first thing I'm going to need in order to do that because right now I've got loads of campaign data in here and I don't want to create a different chart for every campaign.
I want to dynamically change what's on the chart based on the campaign I choose. So we're going to need to do a couple of things here.
We're going to want a tab where we have some sort of drop down over here and then some sort of chart over here where it's displaying cost over time.
But the drop down is going to need to be a list of the campaigns. Now we can't obviously just say grab all of these and just because the name is repeated over and over.
We need a unique list of names. So let's create another tab. Let's call this helper tab. And what we're going to do is use that unique formula.
Now if I start typing unique and hit tab, it's going to fill that in for me. And I said I wanted a unique list of the campaign names.
So let's highlight that whole column of campaigns and hit enter. And that's lovely. It's given me a list of the different campaign names, but it's also included the header.
And if I'm going to put this into a drop down, I don't want the word campaign in there. So I'm just going to edit that formula to say, hey, don't start at the top of column being go all the way to the end.
Start on the second row and go all the way to the end. And then I get rid of that campaign at the top there.
Now the next thing we're going to do is add this drop down file. but for the drop down again I want that to be dynamic as well so if I'm going to create a drop down with this data validation I don't want to have to come over to data validation at a rule and then say campaign one and campaign two and 
I can't even spell campaign and keep going like this because if somebody adds a new campaign or deletes a campaign, this list is going to be wrong.
So I don't want to do that. Instead, what I want to do is to be able to add that list dynamically.
And the only thing that sort of seems to make sense on here is this drop down from a range. But first, we need a range.
Now, what we could do here is just say point this at our range, and say go over to the helper and grab everything in this column and that works.
A slightly neater way would be to use name to ranges but we'll introduce name ranges in a minute. You can do either but for now we're just going to say drop down from a range and then point it to this range that we've defined first with the unique and you see it's it's smart.
It's removed all of these blank rows. We haven't got loads and loads and loads of options on our drop-down. We can also change the colors of these if we want and choose a different color for each drop-down, but I'm not going to sit here and fiddle with that.
Just make for good TV. Good enough. All right. Done. So now we go back to chart. Let's make this column a little bit wider, given our campaign names are a little bit wider.
And drop-down is invalid because input must fall within the specified range because drop down isn't in our list over here.
Now, what we could do is come into here and say, if the data is invalid, show a warning, but because it was on reject, we got that little red icon saying, no, you can't do that.
If we say show a warning, yeah, if I refreshed it, we'd get a different error message there. It doesn't matter.
And then we're not going to change the display start or good. We're just going to choose one of our campaigns from here.
Great. Now, how on earth are we going to display just the cost over here for this campaign? Well, this is where things get a bit funky.
So we will use a named range this time because I want to be able to refer to this sell the value of this drop down.
I want to be able to refer to that in a formula that we're about to create using that query thing that we talked about before.
So a named range can either be a range of sell or a single value. So it's easier to start with a single value.
And there's a couple of ways that we can create this. We can either just pop a name into this name box over here or if this is closed.
We can go to data and then named ranges. I'll get rid of that one. quickly we can create a named range and it says oh because your cursor is in cell BI'm guessing that's where you want to create this named range yes it is thank you very much and I'm going to call this selected campaign so that we can
now refer to this named range and we could do that in a cell and we could say something like my campaign is and then I could start typing selected campaign and it pops up into I think you mean this.
Yes it we do it enter and then it's gonna take the value of the range which is called selected campaign and insert it into our formula so that we something like this.
Now we don't want to do that. We want some data. So let's read a new tab called data. And this is where we're going to use AI for the first time.
And we're going to go over to chat GPT here and say, I have a new tab in my Google sheet called data.
And I want to collect, I want to use the query formula. I don't know how to write it properly, but I want you to write a query formula for me to collect the date and cost data for my selected campaign.
Which I'm going to chart later on on a different tab. I'll show you the data from my first sheet. It's on a tab called sheet one.
I'll show you a little example of what that data looks like in a minute. And I want you to create this query formula for me.
I've got a named range called selected campaign, and I only want to get the date and the cost data for rows that match my selected campaign.
So I'm using a tool called Whisperflow to do this. I'm just going to change that because that will make a difference in our formula because as we're saying, my name brain is called this.
I'm being very precise here. Everything else looks good. Sheet one actually doesn't have a space in. All good. And then let's say sample data.
I'm gonna come over to here, grab a little bit of that data from the first sheet because showing, not telling.
I could take a screenshot of this but I want it to really understand. Maybe there's some stuff here that it can't see in a screenshot.
I want it to understand that these are numbers with decimals and these are integers and so that is usually going to be a Really useful thing to do.
I'm often pasting sample data into an AI So that it understands what's going on now. Let's see if it can cope with that Got it if you had data is in sheet one name ranges this then here is the query formula that you want to use now rather than us spend half an hour learning the query formula I think 
that's a better use of your time to know that there is something there that can what's query doing it's very very similar to that select from where thing that we had inside of our Google ads script let's go ahead and paste this in here and then Oh, that would help if I delete that and just put it in 
a single cell, bingo, bingo. All right. Yeah, that'll do. It's there. It works. And then we're just going to have to trust that when we, What's the first line of that data, ?
Right. So then when we choose a different campaign, our data changes. I was just thinking, do I put that on the same sheet?
Well, I put that on the same sheet, then you can see it. I'll put it down here. Oh, done it again.
Go into a single cell, paste it in front cell, and then you can see, as I change the drop down, my data is changing dynamically.
And if I just delete that one cell, then all of that data disappears, because that one cell was creating all of those cells.
So query is useful when we want to query, we want to get data from a place, and so this is very similar to the select from where.
It's just that this time we're doing the from first, where are we getting data from, which things do you want to select?
Well, it works out that columns A and E are date and cost because we gave it the sample data. So it was able to figure out where date and cost were and we said in that little blurb, I only want data, sorry, date and cost data.
So it did that perfectly. And then where? So select from where, where B because B is campaign, where B equals selected campaign, but it knows the syntax of this.
It knows that it needs a single quote, then a double quote, then an ampersand, then the thing, and then the reverse order of all that.
Not fun to have to learn, right? But hey, I knows this. It's seen millions of these. So let's just use the ParaVai to do what it does best.
Remember all the fiddly details so that we don't have to. Now we just want to chart the data from this data tap.
So if we come back over to here and let's say insert a chart and it's going to say what type of chart do you want?
Let's go a smooth line chart and what's your data range? Okay, let's come over here and say now we don't want that, we want columns A and B from data.
Now yes, there's no data down here, but I think it will be smart enough to get rid of all of these blank cells for us, maybe.
Then we just need to tidy this up. Our x axis is date. We want to remove date from here, and we've got cost on the sorry, yes, date across the x axis, cost on the y axis, and then it's plotting that for us.
Lovely. Let's get rid of you. Let's get rid of you. So we can mess around with this as much as we like.
I'm not going to go deep into charting here, because most of the stuff that we'll do in terms of data manipulation and data visualization, it's so much more powerful now to build a little tool that does that rather than doing all the work inside of Google Sheets.
We'll cover that in later videos, maybe in a different course entirely. I cover this extensively in my build the agent course where we build tools like agent.
I just I love the power of a tool like this. I've loaded this up with sample data so that you can have a play with it.
You can see that I can yeah instantly. This is kind of doing the same thing that we're doing in Google Sheets, but it's able to do it just instantly.
And when I have things like keywords, I've got this little keyword tree here. As I move the slider, the number of the keywords that match cost greater than $changes dynamically.
Now you can't even have a slider in Google Sheets, never mind a tree visualization that changes as the slider moves or on my products page.
I've got this little chart of products here. It's not going to work with sample data. I'll choose some real data and then as I move these thresholds, I've set it up so that my little image moves so that you have this little visualization so you'd have to picture it all in your head, but also the data
changes automatically as I move this up, the number of products in each of these buckets is changing automatically, takes a second or two maybe, sometimes it happens live, just can't do this stuff in a Google sheet.
So that's all in my build the agent course. So I'm not going to go deep into charts here, but I just want to, for now, illustrate that as we change, I really just want to illustrate the formulas at this point.
And so while I'm changing this, the data is changing over here based on our formula with the selected campaign.
So we've learned query, we've learned unique, we've learned named ranges all in the space of five minutes here. And so that as this changes, then our data that is charted changes because the data on our data tab is changing, but it's all coming from here.
So we didn't have to get data from each campaign individually. And then as our script is running tomorrow, it's going to grab data for the last days, and so July the th will disappear, and there'll be a new row down here for August th that we'll get added.
All of this will get cleared out, new data will get put in, but everything else is going to happen automatically, right?
Our little list of campaigns is going to automatically get updated based on the data that is on this first sheet.
If campaigns are removed, if new campaigns are added, our little unique formula is still going to work and that means this is still going to work because we said for the drop down go get all of the options for our drop down go get them from this column over on the helper tab so everything just works 
but rather than this video are getting too long, we'll cover the other formula in a second video. Bye for now.

### Video 5-2: Google Sheet Formulas (12 min)

Welcome back. In this video, I want to cover a couple more Google sheets formula. I want to cover array formula here and conditional formatting.
We've done pretty much everything else other than import range, but I'm going to use a different data set for import range to better, uh, demonstrate that one on also use something that I think would be more useful, uh, to you.
So array formula, what on earth is array formula? Well, let's use the example of row-as since most people people use rowers at some point.
What is rowers? It's the conversion value divided by the cost. And so if we're spending $and making three and a half grand, we've got a rowers of 
Now we could copy that down a few rows. And that's working out our rowers for each row. Say that three times quickly.
Now I could double click that, and it'll fill my formula all the way down to the bottom. But what happens if tomorrow, we have a different number of rows.
If I go and add five rows now, and let's say, you know, this data is automatically being added tomorrow, when the script runs again, there's no formula in these five cells.
Maybe in you campaign, God added, and so our data, the shape of our data is different, there's more rows next time, then if we're manually putting this formula in each row, then something's going to go and break.
So let's get rid of those rows again, and let's go back to the top, quickly delete all of those. What we want instead is a formula that says, hey, do this for every row please, and that's what the array formula does.
And so array formula just simply says, whatever formula comes next, do that for every row. And it works with just about every formula in the Google Sheet system.
So now what we have to do is it rather than just say, hey, go get Gand divide that by Elike we did before, that's not going to work.
Instead, we have to give it and array. So this is where you may want to lean on AI. Why don't we do that?
Let's do the same thing again and paste that in here and then say this is sample data from my Google sheet.
I want to create a formula for return on ad spend row as where I use an array formula to calculate the rowers for all rows of my sheet.
That formula is going to go into either, It's going to go in a column H. I'm not sure where to put it.
Please can you write that formula for me and tell me which cell to put the formula in? Let's assume that we've forgotten.
Should we do it with the header row or should we do it just with the data, I'm not quite sure.
So if column H is your row as a column, put this formula in HAnd again, gobbledygook, right? We don't want to have to remember how to do that.
And as soon as I pasted in, I didn't cheat, I didn't pause the video. As soon as I pasted that in, it completed the formula for me and it filled out all of those rows.
Now this time. These are all zero, so it's not really going to help. Let's grab a chunk of data from the top here.
And zoom down to the bottom and add five more rows. If I add additional data, so maybe new rows are created tomorrow, you can see instantly it automatically fills in the formula for these.
you can see there isn't a formula in this cell anymore there's just the value of the data because the formula is only in that cell right at the top and it's doing it all about actually now the one place you might get in trouble with rowers is if you have stuff in the way of this formula remember this
one formula is trying to fill every row in this column if there's stuff in the way you might get this little error here and says The result couldn't be graded because it would overwrite data in hthis one here if we got rid of that It would say hey, there's stuff in the way in hand we get rid of that
and then you get the picture as soon as we get rid of this It's able to do its thing and put that data in every row Did we want to use that?
No, I'm just talking with the idea of changing our chart to show this is because I put that data, that extra data at the bottom so it's getting a bit confused on a chart.
I was talking with the idea of charting row as instead of cost but maybe I'll let you have a go at doing that.
You figure out what would need to change hint maybe a query what would need to change in order to chart row as instead of cost hint hint hint.
Also that might need to change too because to begin with we said only go and get data in columns A through G and you might want to get column H as well now but I'll let you figure that one out.
All right the only other thing I want to cover in this video is conditional formatting. So before we had a lot of zeros on the chart down towards the bottom of this data set but it can kind of be a bit visually messy.
Sometimes these can get in the way a little bit. So one thing I like to do often is to highlight the whole tab, then I'll come into format and conditional formatting and say if the cell is equal to zero, I don't want to see it in green, thank you very much.
I don't want So that way, all of the zeros just kind of drop out of the way and it's just easier to see especially when it's lots and lots of zeros and a few bits of data.
It just makes the few bits of data kind of pop out of the screen more and easier to see. This reminds me of something else.
Let's do one more. So that's conditional formatting. You can use it for all kinds of different things. you can highlight rows where numbers are greater or equal than something else.
For instance, let's do cost, let's add another rule, such that if the cost is greater than or equal to a hundred, then we'll have the green box, otherwise we won't, and then we'll have another rule of If the cost is less than or equal to then let's have a red one done.
So now the higher numbers, that would have been smarter to use a slightly less common number. Our higher numbers are in green and our lower numbers are in red.
So it's really, really flexible, really useful to be able to make data pop out. But again, if you're doing a lot of the analysis in the Google sheet, I actually don't spend much time in a Google sheet anymore, because I'm doing everything in -or building little apps for stuff, but if you're spending
a lot of time in sheets, this is a very, very useful thing to know. Let's go fix that error that we saw before too.
So, row S, conversion value divided by cost, right? So if cost is zero in a few places and we get this horrible divide by zero error, well normally we'd have to change a bunch of different formulas because of that but we've got everything all in the one formula this whole column is managed by this array
formula so I think we might be able to wrap this big formula in this thing of if error And I put, if error, oops, let's go back into there, sorry, sorry, I can't make that row any bigger.
It doesn't matter how much I increase the zoom of this, it's a way, there is a way, there is a way, uh, usually increasing, oh that's, yeah, it's not really going to help too much but let's squish this over a little bit so we can still see this column and then this is hopefully a little bit bigger for
you to boot. So all I did I just added if error in here and then Google added the additional bracket that we needed because Google smart and it fills that stuff in for me but I've put it after the array formula.
So array formula and then said if there's no error basically that's If there's no error, then show the result of this.
If there is an error, just leave it blank. And I just like that. It's just a bit neater and tidier rather than having those div zero errors throughout your code.
Again, it just makes the data that you want to see kind of pop out and easier to spot. All right, in the next video, we will cover import range.
That's really the last Lego brick with all these Google sheet formulas that you really need but just sort of get I would suggest getting the habit of coming to your favorite AI whatever it is you use and getting in the habit of again like I did before just just talking through the problem I'm not trying
to be precise I'm I'm trying to demonstrate that on purpose by saying things like I'm not sure where to put it it's very vague it's it's really yet a year or two ago that probably wouldn't have worked but today's AI is that smart that it's going to figure out what you mean.
And this is why I love dictation software like whisper flow. It's so much better than the dictation that's built into Mac.
I've no idea what dictation out of the boxes like on PCs, but dictation on a map is Mac is pretty rubbish.
Whisper flow, which again, if you get a roads.ai, that will redirect you. You'll see this referral code on the end here.
You get $worth credits, I get $worth of credits. My kids get a Lego for Christmas and then you just go download that.
I think you can use it for free for the first words, something like that. I absolutely love this tool.
I use it all day every day now. Have been for months. Absolutely love it. I highly suggest working with it because you're able just to get more stuff out of your head faster than if you're having to type.
If as much context and AI needs context in order to help us to the more context you give it the better, which is why I show it, sample data and then just ramble for seconds and usually that's enough for it to figure out what I want.
If it doesn't figure it out first time, I'll come back in here and I'll ramble again for another seconds and then it's going to give me the answer I need.
So I'll see you back for one more. Google Sheet Formula which is import range in the next video.

---

### Video 5-3: Google Sheet Formulas (14 min)

Hey, welcome back. Alright, let's look at the import range formula. So the reason that you would use this formula is to move large chunks of data from one sheet to another sheet.
And one use case where this is really useful is in my Pmax sheet. So the Pmax script, obviously powers a Pmax sheet.
Um, there is a tab there called ID. So So maybe you've played with this, maybe you haven't, but this ends up giving you a two columns, a list of product IDs, and then the bucket that that fits into.
So I have these six buckets, profitable costly flukes, meh, zombies, and zero conversions. Now this is very similar to a script that came out after I created this.
They didn't see it. I didn't see theirs. They didn't copy. I didn't copy just to be clear. but you've probably heard of it.
You maybe use it, FlowBoost's laborlizer script. It's really, really good. It is definitely a more grown up version than this.
It's more powerful and it does this one thing very, very, very well. But my script is a version of that.
So I have these product categories. Should tidy that up in the mind. I have these product categories and a certain number of products in each category based on recent data.
Not going to explain that here, but I want to now create a supplemental feed. I want to use this data, this list of IDs, and the buckets they're in.
I want to use that as a supplemental feed in Merchant Center to add these labels as a custom label. So if we do a quick search for custom label, we You can see that custom labels, sometimes called custom dimension, we have these options and it's kind of weird, right, because we have five labels you would
think but no, is done by geeks and so it's from through So the first label is custom label 
So what I've done is because we're not trying to remember these formula, here's one I prepared earlier. I've just rambled for five seconds this time instead of seconds and I've just said I've got some data and I want to use import range out.
I've got this thing in the back of my brain that tells me I want to use import range to move to copy this data from one sheet to another.
I want to put it into a new sheet and I want to call the first column ID but I know I can't call this this second column bucket because Google Merchant Center isn't going to understand what bucket means.
I want the second column to be called custom label zero. How do I do it? All right, let's see what the AI suggests.
So you can't rename columns directly, but we can wrap it in the query. Okay, well, I was gonna do this manually, but sure, let's do the thing that it is saying here.
How I would have done this first is to first create a new sheet. And then use import range. As I start to type, it should.
I hate the way sometimes it just doesn't work in that first cell. Let's go import range. And then it's going to ask me for two separate things, a spreadsheet URL and a range.
Well, the spreadsheet URL is easy, right? That's just this thing. I'm going to, again, keep all the gobbledygook on the end.
I'm not going to try and tidy it up and be fancy. But this tells me if I look at this, that I need to wrap this in quotes.
I remember that, maybe you don't, in which case it won't work, the first time, and then you'll remember. But I've got this range, and then I have to do a comma, I have to do a range string, what a hell is a range string?
Well the range string is just saying which tab are you getting it from? And which range do you want? This is the range up here in the name box.
So, if I highlight these cells, it's from cell Adown to cell BWell, I want the whole thing, which is this.
So, it's all of A up until the end of all of B. And it's on the tab called ID. So, I go back to my new thing and now it's difficult to see because this is in the way.
But I've got my import range. I've got my URL wrapped in quotes. And then I'm I have another quote and say it's on tab ID.
I have to put an exclamation mark in between the tab name and the range. I'm gonna say A through B, close quotes, go.
I'm gonna sneakily delete those top two rows and pretend that we put this in the top here. So I will typically bold that and move that down, change my column width a little bit so I can see what's going on.
And the reason I move that down there, that's going to freeze a certain number of rows. Ah, I didn't mean to do that, I moved the wrong thing.
That's going to freeze a certain number of rows. It's the same as going up to view, freeze, and I want to change that to one row so that as I scroll down, my headers stay where they are.
I'm sure you've used that before, but if not, you can either use the thing under view freeze rows or you can grab try and get that little hand icon back you can grab these sort of slightly thicker gray things here you can drag this one across here so that as you scroll across these ones stay fixed and
this one you grab and bring down to then your header stays fixed as you scroll sorry that was a tangent you really didn't need to know all that did you maybe it's useful maybe it's not.
Now, what I would have done is I would have brought that in and then worked out that I want to change the name of this column.
But if I do that, my formula breaks. So then I've got to figure out, oh, actually, I wanted to bring in everything from row two down.
And that's when things get a little bit messy. I would actually have to go back into my formula I would have to find this.
I'd have to say let's grab everything from a to down to the end of b. Then I would actually have to move this formula down to here because I need it to start in row two.
Stay with me. Stay with me. And this one I was going to call id and this one I was going to call custom label zero.
That's the slow way of doing it. That's We've done it, that's how I've always done it in the past. So, let's see what ChatGbDrecommends.
It says, right, you can't do that. As we've just seen, if we try and change the column name, either manually or try to do it with import range, it's not gonna work.
But this is now combining import range together with query that we covered in an earlier video and try to do everything all in one go.
So let's just try this. and it says to go put this into cell one and the original tab is called PMax performance and nope the original tab is called id all capitals id.
I love whisper flow. So did you notice that then where I said it's called id all capitals id it didn't just do the dictation thing of put that exactly as I said it it used some smarts in the background to understand what I was saying and why I was saying that and just paste in the original tab it's called
ID this is why I love whisper flow it's so good okay so now it's changed it and it's changed the formula based on that new information so now if we copy this into cell Aover here I've done it again haven't I double-click into cell one so that I paste the formula into cell Aand hit go.
Nah, spreadsheet cannot be found. Oh, I didn't give it my spreadsheet. I'm an idiot. Okay, I've said this in a different video.
Context is everything and since I actually didn't tell it that the URL of my spreadsheet, it made this up. I didn't even notice.
Oh, dear, one idea. All right, sheet URL is that. Maybe I'll just change that to say original sheet URL is that so that now it can change the whole thing for me.
Oh, it's different, okay. So I usually put the full URL in, but what it has done is it's taken the ID out of here, which is this part here and apparently this will work with just IDs which is a little bit neater and not quite as messy to look at.
So let's delete that, let's go again, double-click into there, paste that in and bingo, bingo. So now we have ID and custom label, help if I didn't bold that bit from before and bold the headers.
Perfect, that's exactly what we wanted but now we've done it all with just this single command, or the single formula, combining a couple of other formulas.
So again, another great example of why we don't want to have to try and remember all of this gobbledygook through here, select column one, select column two, but label it, the column one labeled this and column two labeled that.
I'm never going to remember that syntax. Maybe you will, I don't know, maybe if you do better than me, if you do.
But we don't need to remember. We just need to describe, with context, text and telling the URL, telling the ID tab, these little details, definitely help AI.
But once it has all the information that it needs, it creates the formula correct first time. And it's all done.
And now we can use this, so we could name this. Now what's going to happen is whenever this thing runs again, and it would have put So tomorrow the script has run, the data has changed, the data in the supplemental feed and sheet obviously changes automatically and instantly.
As soon as it changes on that other tab, it changes instantly in here and then this is the tab that we could then upload to Google Merchant Center and say, right, grab all of the information from here.
I'm not going to go into how to do that now. I'm sure if this is a useful thing for you, you will figure it out.
Maybe you're already doing something similar, but that's how you can automatically move a large chunk of data from one sheet to another sheet automatically.
And apparently change the column headers while you're doing it by using query as well. Never done that before. Obviously you have to get the names of that column headers right and that's why I'm just doing a quick search for something like custom label just to make sure we get the syntax exactly right
. The other thing we could have done is copy that URL and made that part of the context so that we could have said, you know, how are we going to do that?
Custom label one, you know, get the detail for custom labels from this website. Please read the website and make sure that you format things properly because maybe we didn't remember that they had underscores or maybe we didn't remember that it was zero to four.
So I want the second column to be called a custom label. And we gave it that and said, read this.
Let's just try it again. I haven't put the URL in there. I haven't put the ID thing in there. It didn't do a very good job of that.
But sometimes Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't, there you go, check GPT-That's why you should use Claude, I reckon.
Anyway, there we go. That's all of your sheet formulas that you're going to need to know. Those named ranges come in very, very handy when you're trying to move data from a sheet into your code and back again, particularly useful for something like once we're getting outside the sheets, put your
going from a script into a sheet and you're pushing data between the two, the script can change the value of named ranges in your sheet.
So it can actually send data into the sheet and put it in a specific place based on where that name ranges.
I'll give you some use cases for that later on, but very, very useful to use named ranges, rather than trying to remember, was it cell For Gor did somebody move that?
So using named ranges super useful but those are really all the formula that you need to know at this point really don't need any more than that just remember those Lego blocks remember what the thing is that you want to do and if you don't remember the formula just describe to the AI hey I've got this
idea I think I know what I want to do is there a formula that does this thing and just hold down the button only keyboard, install whisper flow, hold the button down, and a ramble for seconds, and more often than not, the AI will sort it out.
I'll see you in the next video.

## Module 6: MCC Scripts

### Video 6-1: MCC Scripts (11 min)

Hey, Mike here again. In this module, we're gonna cover MCC scripts. Super powerful, super useful. The huge benefit really being that you install a script once in that top level of your MCC, and then that logic can run across all of the accounts within that MCC, or just the ones that you choose.
But it means that one, you only have to install a script once, and it can run across everything. If that script needs to change or be updated, you only have to make one change instead of potentially hundreds.
But also, as per the first bullet here, the owners of those accounts can't see the script that's running on that account.
Great for audits. If you can add someone's account to your MCC, you can have your audit script ready and waiting.
Run it on that new account, spit out your page report or whatever it is, all of the tabs in a sheet that you use for a look or report.
However, you do your audit, all of that can be done in just a few minutes because the script is ready and waiting.
But the owner of that account can't see your script, they can't steal your script just because they've been linked to your MCC.
So incredibly useful, a great way to scale the work that you do. Now, not saying that scripts can replace humans nowhere near it, but there are so many tasks that they can help your team with why not do that across every single account so that when your team need the data in order to do a task even if
they do that task once a week. You run the script every day and the data is just there ready for them whenever they happen to need it.
It's scripts are free to run. it's so powerful just to have that everything done proactively just to be there ready and waiting.
So we're going to focus on reporting. We're focused, we're going to use the example of conversion actions and being able to grab the conversion action data for all of the accounts in an MCC, a script that you could run hourly or daily.
But we're going to do it in three different ways. So if we jump across into cursor, let's talk about the first way, but I want to give you three different Lego blocks, essentially three different ways of doing this, to get progressively a little bit more complicated maybe, but progressively more powerful
because again, you're not trying to learn how to write JavaScript, we just need to know what the Lego bricks are so that we can ask the AI to create the script for us.
So a couple of little things I want to point out, first of all, the config of the top here, the configuration.
What I will typically do is leave the sheet URL blank. If the user leaves it blank, a sheet gets created and we show them that in the logs, but then we expect that they will take that URL and put it into the script for run number two, run number three, et cetera, so that we use that sheet from then on
. But if they forget, if they don't want to produce it in there the first time, the script isn't going to fall over again.
If there's any kind of mistake by the user, we want the script to fail gracefully or preferably not fail at all.
Now when we're setting up and testing an MCC, it might take -minutes to run an MCC script if it has to iterate over hundreds of accounts.
We don't want to have to wait minutes just to find out that there's an error in the code. So, I will typically have this sort of line at the top where we can have one or two accounts that we enter to use for testing purposes, just to check that the logic is all working.
And then once it is, we'll remove those two CIDs. If this string is blank, then it runs across all accounts.
same sort of thing. We don't want to pick some long time frame. And again, therefore, I have to wait longer because more data means slower scripts means writing more data to sheets, which is going to take longer.
So I'll typically start with a short time frame. And then if you want, you can add a longer time frame later.
You can't have last days. I've said this before, but the AI loves creating last underscore underscore days, which is impossible and won't work.
But you could easily have a function here that creates the code in order to pull data for a longer time period.
That can be a great little homework project for you. Just ask the AI to create that. For you paste this script in, tell it what you want, and it'll give you a new script.
And then lastly, we have the sheet name, or the tab name, that we're going to create inside of our Google sheet.
Now the last little bit to look at here is just this main function. So essentially what we're doing is saying, hey, the account that this script is installed in.
Is it actually an MCC account? If it is, great. Let's carry on doing what we intended to do, but if this has accidentally been installed into a single account, not an MCC, then let's do this other thing.
And rather, again, rather than just fall over and fail and have a big red error message, it's going to carry on and do the thing, in this case grab conversion data, it's going to just do that thing for the single account.
So I use this exact same logic in my negative keyword script, which I'm going to show you a little bit later on.
Put the same thing happens there so that you can run the same script in either type of account and it works perfectly for both.
So let's take this code, jump over into an MCC, clear that out and hit preview. Again, we have not entered a sheet URL yet, and so we should get a message saying that one is being created for us.
There we go, created new spreadsheet, new spreadsheet created, and it gives us that URL. And then we can see that we're running in test mode because we entered a couple of CIDs, so let's open up that sheet.
We've got sheet one here, and then daily conversion data. Now I have for the purposes of this video just replaced the account name with dummy name for filming for both accounts here, but you can see I've got and down here we've got and then we have which I will just cover up that as well
. We have some different conversion action names. You just have to take my word for it that this column D is the conversion action name and so for each day for each account we have the various conversion action names and the various Conversions that are the various metric, the number of conversions that
each one has received. Now, in this particular case, I'm using all conversions, so just know that there is a difference in scripts between all conversions and conversions, I probably should have named that column differently.
Actually, let me show you how to do that. Why not? Let's dive into here. Let's search for conversions, and here we go.
So we could just change that to all conversions and then next time this script runs, we'll have a slightly better named column.
So now let's also take the URL. This is what we would do next, take the URL and go and plug that into the sheet URL and then remove our test IDs because this only took seconds to run for a couple of them.
I would then hit Preview and then I would leave this running, expecting it to take a couple of minutes. There are a couple of hundred accounts in here.
Again, I've removed the account names, but now it's going to run through all of the accounts in this MCC exactly what we wanted and once it's done doing that, it will clear the sheet which is already done and then it will paste all of the data in one hit into the sheet.
The reason we want it to paste in in one hit is because scripts will run quite slowly if it's just writing one line at a time into your sheet because every time it has to have a chat with the sheet, that takes time.
And especially with an MCC script, we have to be aware of the execution time of our script. We don't want to be writing a line that going back and finding some more data and then going back and writing some more because we have that minute time limit, we want our script to run as efficiently as possible
. So worth remembering that so that you can ask your AI to make sure that we optimize for the execution time of the script.
Let's write this script in a smart way such that we are not wasting time and one of the ways I like to do that is just collect all of the data that we're going to write to the sheet.
Essentially we tell it to collect all of that data in memory, and then once it's collected everything, then go right to the sheet.
So I have no idea how many accounts are in here, but I'll just pause this for a moment and then we'll come back once the data is written to the sheet.
Okay, the script has finished running now. We've got rows of data written to the sheet, so it ran through all of the accounts, took two and a half minutes and just reminded us at the bottom here of that sheet URL you can see that matches and then over here we have all of our different accounts 
all of those different metrics and if we scroll down rows so I will remove that dummy if we search for dummy you can see that I changed the account name from the name it's fetched from the Google ads account and replaced it with this account name, dummy name, filming.
So if we comment that line out, it now won't change the name from whatever the name is to dummy name, and that name will get used in the processing.
So I don't imagine that you need that line, but I'll leave that there as a comment just to help remind you what we did.
I'm going to end this video here before this gets too long and then the next one will come back with a different way of doing it.
So here we've got one huge tab with all of the account data all in one big long list. Now that's one way of doing it but if we wanted to get a more complicated data than this we might need some different ways of doing it.
So in the next video what we'll do is we will look at creating a tab for each account and then the third one will do something even more powerful but a little bit more complicated.
We'll get to that. I'll see you in the next video.

### Video 6-2: MCC Scripts (12 min)

Welcome back. Alright, MCC Part What we're gonna do now is look at a slightly different Lego Blick, Lego Blick, Lego Blick or Blick.
You choose. Um, a different pattern for getting your MCC data out into a sheet. So this time we're gonna put the data for each account into a separate tab, but all into one spreadsheet.
So usual patterns, usual configuration, uh, We have a sheet URL, which if it's blank, we're going to create one for them.
We've got a couple of CIDs for testing, short time period, a slightly different pattern here as well, just as an alternative to the CID for testing, which is if you, or once you remove the two accounts here for testing, maybe you only want to get accounts above a certain threshold during whichever time
period we have set. so if you've got hundreds and hundreds of accounts in your MCC, you can come in here, set that to or or any number you choose, and then it'll only create tabs for the accounts that hit that threshold, and then tab naming, which I'll talk about in just a second.
Now, I've already placed this into the account because I need to hide some data here, and we'll dive directly into the sheet.
So I'm just graying out the names of the accounts there and just keeping this hidden. By default, the column names are automatically resized to the conversion action name, but that conversion action name reveals a bit too much.
So I've just made that column a little bit smaller us a rather than run the script again, which will resize the column.
I've just made a couple of changes here. And then what it's going to do is for each account, it's going to create this index page for us at the beginning of the sheet so that we can click on that and come directly to the tab.
Because if you have, again, hundreds of tabs, it might be a little bit challenging to find those. I use a tool that helps me sort all of the tabs by Alphanumeric order.
That might be useful. It could be another thing we could add to the script. But I'm using the CID as the tab name here.
What that other constant at the top does, this tab naming constant, is if you set use account name to be true, it will use the account name for each of the tabs.
Now I see two potential problems with that one account names are usually longer than the CID and I don't like really long tab names because it means I can only see you know maybe two three four tabs on the screen at a time whereas with the CID I can probably see almost a dozen tabs there but the other
thing is what happens when the name changes the name is just an attribute of what is current right now if somebody changes the name of the account then you're going to end up with two tabs, one with the old name and the old data and then one with the new data since the name changed and that would be 
a bit of a pain to try and put those together whereas the CID never changes and so typically I will use data that never changes.
I'll use campaign IDs instead of campaign names, account IDs instead of account names. And generally just means less trouble with the code.
So that's another way of doing it. And if we jump back into cursor, I have a third way of doing it.
And I've given you a cut down version here, but I'm also going to give you my negative keyword sheet. So this, I sell for bucks, I think.
You'll see this one is quite long. This is about and lines of code almost exactly yours to take and play with and change that does a ton of stuff but what I wanted to give you from it was the the pattern so rather than give you three thousand lines of code and say feed this into an AI good luck 
I've created a cut down version of that for you usual patterns here sheet URL blank selected time seven days to start with but This time we've got two different taps.
So we'll grab that and get it running, chuck it into the account. And then if I need to, I'll pause the video and hide the data on there.
But what this is gonna do is create a master sheet. So if you've used my PMAX script, or maybe my negative keyword script that you're gonna get, it does a couple of things.
on the first run it populates the all tab the all accounts tab in this case sometimes I call it just all in this case all accounts something along this line and that is a list of all of the accounts in the MCC typically sorted by cost in descending order in other words high to low the reason for that
is that I don't want you to have to go into Google ads and copy and paste and type out out the digit CID to set up the configuration.
I want to make that as easy as possible for you. You want to do the same. You want your scripts to be easy to use by the end user.
And so as we'll see in a minute, we're going to get a list of all of those accounts, CIDs, names, and for context, the spend in the last days.
Just so I have a vague understanding of which accounts might be more important than others. Then what we do, and this is exactly the same if you've used my PMax script, we then copy the CIDs and the names of the accounts that we want the script to run on across into the Settings tab.
Okay, the script has gone across. That has now finished running. It took about a minute for accounts here and it created a new sheet, which I've opened in a new tab.
Again, and I've just grayed out that list of client names because we've got the cost shown next to them. And so she won, we can get rid of.
We don't need that anymore. And we've got two tabs. We've got that all accounts tab, which is the list of everything.
And then settings, which is the bit that we're interested in, essentially. So if we go down here, grab a couple of these and paste them into settings.
let me just wind that up first and set that so that it doesn't show and then paste that in there.
Of course, it's still going to show, isn't it? Now, if we run the script again, it's probably going to show the names anyway in there.
But what should happen now in our Mastersheet? For each account that it finds, it's going to create a spreadsheet with the data that we wanted for each account and then put the link to that spreadsheet in here, our account URL cell in here and a timestamp for when that last run happened, excuse me, and
the status. So as this runs through and creates the Now, exactly the same pattern that I use for the PMACs and you'll see when you run the negative keyword script in here as well, it's exactly the same pattern.
This just obviously does a lot more stuff and is a bit more complicated. But this is really useful if you want lots of different types of data for each account.
So maybe you want a tab for keyword data or a tab for search terms, a tab for placements, etc. etc, etc, etc.
So very, very similar to how works. If you've logged in for it does the same thing. It creates a sheet for each account and there are about tabs also for each account and then that data gets read into 
It uses a very, very similar system to this. So that's just another pattern, another way of doing it. So we've covered three things.
We've got one that was the simple version. That was just a single tab with all of the data and the single tab.
So it listed the account CID and account name, and then the data that we wanted. We could then do some interesting things with that data.
We didn't for the sake of time here, but we could chart that data. We could pull it into the app.
We could run a large language model over the top of that and look for changes, chart out the data so we can spot when conversions have fallen off a cliff.
That's really the point of all of this, probably should have said that earlier, is by having all of this data, then we can do some interesting stuff with it so that we can spot where maybe some conversion code has been deleted and conversions drop down to zero for a particular conversion action so we
can spot those things nice and early. Now, our second one, we had multiple tabs in a single sheet. So one tab per account, either using the CID or using the account name.
And then in this last one, we're then creating a different sheet for each individual client. Ah, I made a mistake, didn't I?
I didn't, having done all of that fun stuff, you know what I should have done? I should have taken this URL and thrown that into the top of the sheet.
It looks like that'll take about another minute. So I'll do that now rather than have to change everything and gray it out and do everything that we did over in this master sheet.
I didn't send it back to the same place and so it then ran through and created the all accounts tab again, but in a different sheet because I'm an idiot and didn't put that URL in there.
So there you go. It's created that seconds. It's done both of those beautiful and created a sheet for each one with the date stamp.
So it's really quick. Once you get it up and running, this is the slow bit to go through and grab the data for every single account.
But then once you've got, I mean, maybe you want to run the sheet on all of them in which case you copy all of that, maybe the whole thing across to the settings tab.
And then we have some other patterns of dealing with that again. If you've used my PMAC script, you'll know that then I have an additional column, which is called run at.
And so then I tell it which hour of the day to update a particular account, but we'll leave that for another day.
We shouldn't need that here. But now you've got a whole bunch of different ways of dealing with MCCs. The way I'm expecting you to use these three scripts I've given you is give whichever pattern you like for your particular use case, give one of these scripts to an AI and say using this as the base,
I want to do blah blah blah blah blah blah. Please write the new script for me and give me the new script and then you're off to the races, and you've got something decent to copy to give the AI as a starting point, which should save you a whole lot of pain.
But more importantly, you've got a few different Lego blocks in your head now, different things that you can ask the AI for, because you know a bunch of different ways of what's possible.
That's the key thing. Is knowing what's possible, knowing what to ask for. You don't have to remember how to write any of this code.
You're never going to write the code. You just need to ask for the right thing. I'll see you in the next video.

## Module 7: Apps Scripts

### Video 7-1: Apps Scripts (19 min)

So if we jump into Brave, um, scripts.google you can see down the bottom here there are a few little examples in the getting started section highly recommend you have a look there.
But I'm gonna dive straight into a use case because I think by seeing some of the power of this I'm hoping that it will trigger some ideas for yourself.
So I have here, uh, three emails from Sam sitting in my inbox and I use this pattern a lot. of labels.
You can see I've got a whole bunch of different labels that I use in Gmail. So I've created this label and I've put z-dash just so it sorts it down to the bottom of the list.
I just try and keep that list fairly tidy. And so I've got this label z-sam that automatically gets applied based on some filters that I've set up.
In other words, an email coming from that email address maybe with this header. I'm sure you understand Gmail filters. So I'm going to use the power of built-in stuff in Gmail.
I'm not going to try and write a script that scans through every single email looking for something from Sam. I'm going to use the power of Gmail first and then the script is looking for the label and that just keeps things needed.
It's a little bit like we used named ranges in sheets earlier. It just keeps things tidy. And what I want it to do and where I started, again, I've iterated my way to the script you're going to see now.
But what I started with is I just want to take every single one of these emails. And when I get an email come in, I want to add it to this sheet.
And you can see all of the old emails from Sam here. So I want you to grab the date. I obviously I know who it's from, but let's put the from in here.
The subject and then I did that's all I did for the first iteration just to prove that it would work And then once I got that working, I said well, let's extract the body because these emails that Sam writes are really long and You'll see if I dive into here look at that little scroll bar here It's a
really long email. There's this gold living in every single one of Sam's emails They are absolutely fabulous, but they are huge, which is why they end up sitting in my inbox for ages Because I just don't always have the half hour to read them then and there So that's what we iterated away to again the
code itself doesn't matter You just need to know okay How do I break this down into a small little test project?
What's the littlest thing? I can do here. I've added a label to an email a single email can you go and find that label in my Gmail account and extract the date who it's from and the subject and put that into a sheet and just literally just describe that to your favorite AI ask it to build an apps script
and then we'll go create that. So how you get into the apps script is go extensions and then apps script and that will open up this window.
So we've got a few little files down the side here. We've got triggers, we've got the code editor, we've got project settings.
I pretty much never use any of these because as you'll see we're going to have the AI right to the code to create triggers for us.
Currently I don't have any triggers in here. So we're going to test this for the first time. So we'll go back to the code.
What I have and it actually might be easier to read this in cursor. So I have a little configuration section so that you can add if you want to copy this and test something similar, you can add a label and then a folder.
That's going to come in later on. This is one that I use all the time. So again, all you need to know here is just being able to ask the AI, hey, when I open the sheet for the first time, please add a little menu at the top that does these things.
And again, you'll iterate there. You'll start with just create a menu and put one thing in there and then we'll iterate that over time.
So all I've done so far is paste all of the script in here. It's going to do a bunch of stuff.
I've saved it and then I go back to the sheet and press refresh. And then you'll see up here next to help that new menu item will appear in the second.
So that's that on edit as soon as we go into the sheet, the script runs behind the scenes and it pops up my little thing here.
So it's added a few options here. We've got extract emails and then I want to export. So after I had them all in here, I realized that sheets are a really horrible place to try and read this.
If I wanted to read, I plan on giving all of this information to an AI. that'll be a future step of building the knowledge base.
But I thought well it'd be nicer to have those each one of these as its own document. And so that was the next part of the script I created.
And so here's that latest one here number one two five. So I've extracted them all as text documents and saved them in this folder.
And hence the folder ID, this to one here, the folder ID in that config section at the top. All right, so let's just give it a bash.
So if we go back into here, Gmail Processor, let's extract, and I've just noticed there's a new email coming in, all right, that's okay, that's just a GitHub one.
So I've got three here, I'm expecting, one, two, six, one, two, seven, and one, two, eight, to flow through into my sheet, hopefully.
Okay, we'll give it permissions. I realize that won't pop up on the video, but I'm just going to go in there and hit continue.
I never know when you do the authorization if it's still running or not. Yeah, okay, it is. It's still running.
So it's adding a new row. Beautiful. Well, almost. It didn't do one two. Oh, there we go. So it did one two six one two seven one two eight.
It's now changed the order, but that's okay. because I can change that in a minute, I can just drag these and change them.
And in future, when comes in, that'll go up to the top. So we'll get rid of those in a minute.
And again, I could iterate on the script here to say, hey, once you've extracted these and brought them into the sheet, then file, oh, I did.
it. Then file these and pop them down into here. I'm guessing if we refresh that, that inbox flag will disappear.
And it's going to keep the label because I want all of those to stay grouped yet. So that inbox flag has disappeared.
It just took a couple of seconds to flow through and they've been moved out of my inbox for me. Perfect.
Now I've got these files and that was fine at the beginning but then what I added and iterated my way there was I want to export these but I want to keep track of what I've exported because when I export I don't want it to go through every single file again so therefore need to keep track of those so
hopefully now it will just add three new files and export to drive text files and hoping it'll just do those three and won't try and do every single thing again we will see so if we go into here what we should find depending on which way up this is sorted there we go sorted at the top there we go great
and that latest email has now been extracted turned into a text file these will be much easier to feed into an AI to use as a knowledge base later on that's why I've done text files, not Google Docs, so that multiple different AIs have no problem reading those and all I'll have to do
later on is just point it to that folder and then I've got basically Sam's brain on tap. Now, it created those, did it do the next thing?
Yes, it did great. It added those little ticks next to there. Now, the next thing we want to do is we want this whole thing to run automatically.
So I'm going to tell it to set up that daily trigger. Now, I know that Sam only sends his emails once a week, but that's okay.
I can just have this check once a day. Beautiful. So it's going to run at a.m. every day. And when we get to Sunday or Monday, whenever it runs after Sam has sent that, the labels being added automatically in Gmail.
So then this will run, it'll pull everything through, it'll export as the text file, take it out of the inbox and everything just happens automatically.
You'll just have to trust me that a week from now, next week, one, two, nine gets added to that. And if it doesn't, all I tend to do is I go back into extensions, I go back into Apps Group to remember we give the AI as much context as possible.
I would copy this whole thing including my folder ID and so on. What have we got here? lines of code trivial for an AI.
I'd give it all of that and then I would explain the problem and what I want to happen. This thing is processing every email every time or it's missing this or it's bringing it in but it's not exporting it to the folder.
I just explain that to an AI, ask it to update the code, come back in here, delete all of this, paste in the new code, save it and then test it and run it again.
and off to the races. So there you go, that's knowledge-based creation from an email newsletter. And we're starting to tie in a few things.
We've got Gmail, Sheets, and Drive, and, well, sort of docs, but we've done it as a text file. So we've combined a few different things there, just in lines of code.
So you could think about, I would suggest, if you'll see they're going great, but how do I use this? Have a conversation with your favorite AI.
and so I've just learned about Google Apps scripts. I'm struggling to think of a use case where I could use this to practice.
Help me brainstorm a simple short use case where something that I use Google Sheets for where we could use this.
So maybe it's a new row gets added to a sheet and you want to send a message to a Slack channel.
Try that. Or a new email comes in from a particular client. maybe you have a tab down here for each client and you just want to keep track of all of the emails that have come in because you're building a knowledge base or a project and you plan on taking those emails and passing them through to an application
or a sana or click up or whatever it is that you use. So just pick one small thing if you can't think of anything at all brainstorm storm with your favorite AI, Claude, GPT-whatever you choose, and go back and forth with the AI to try and find something that you can use as a little test case, and 
then it's just a case of iterating on that, because once you pick up these Lego pieces and play with it, and once you say, wow, oh, if I can do that, and that was so easy, what else could I do?
What else could I do? And then you'll just keep on iterating from there, and have a play in here. Come into Google's thing and have a little play.
Maybe you want to do this, maybe you want to add a little sidebar to Google Sheets, to help with keyword research, or to look through some data and make suggestions.
I have no idea. This is the thing, right? Everybody uses this stuff so, so differently. But find a use case, have AI, write the code, have AI create the trigger for you, have AI create the menu item for you.
These are so useful. You can have a whole bunch of these lined up across the top here and just have play experiment and see what you can build.
I'll see you in the next video.

## Module 8: The Mega Prompt

### Video 8-1: The Mega Prompt (14 min)

We'll jump over to Kerser and you can see from this that it is, there's a lot of text here Now you've got a couple of options with this If you hate Kerser and you don't want to ever go near Kerser ever again, then what you could do is just copy all of that out of Kerser, jump back into Claude or your
favourite AI and let's say, uh, write a short Google ads script to fetch search terms, use the document below for inspiration and ideas.
So let's just put that in and then I'm going to paste that in as one big document and hit go.
So that will probably work okay. Yes, I've got some notes in this particular megaprompt that is prompting me just to make sure that things don't go wrong.
So let's go to that search term view page that we looked at before and actually I will change version here, version before we give that to the UI, to the AI.
We'll copy that and we'll put that in there. So resource is that. Date range, yes, used the last days, segmentation.
I'd like the data segmented by campaign and segmented by date so that I can chart this later. Let's sort it by date.
And with the sheet URL, no, I don't have an existing URL put a sheet constant at the top. If the user forgets to enter a sheet, then create one for them and show them the URL in the logs, otherwise use the sheet that the user gives you.
So clearly I need to work on the examples in the mega prompt, having just used that as the example that I told you.
It did the same thing. Right, so it's first going to have a little read so that it understands this search term view.
If I hadn't entered that, or if you didn't know which resource to use, you could say to it, look, just guess.
use your big brain and figure something out and guess and then it's gone off and decided here's all the stuff it should do and we've got our main, we've got some calculated metrics and it's often running.
Now we could do the same thing over in let me just close this so it doesn't get confused. We could do the same thing in cursor here.
And you've got a couple of options. I would often create a new blank, let's call it test.js, a new blank script first.
Just to make sure that it uses that document, that script file for the new script, rather than risk it messing up on a my existing scripts just to be really, really precise.
And we do the same thing in here. Write a new simple Google ads script using the examples provided and create this new script in the test.js file.
And you'll notice that the audio that I'm using whisper flow, get a roadster AI, actually does things with file names as well.
So what I'm going to do here though, because I wanted to show you the other way of doing this. You can do it using voice, but if you don't have whisper flow using the examples provided in.
And then if we just add mega prompt, you can attach a file to your prompt. And so this is another benefit of doing all of this in cursor.
You've got your library of all of your scripts. Maybe you could say look at this other script of mine for ideas if you didn't have the mega prompt.
Instead of trying to find it every time, find it in Google Drive or over your story documents, download it, and then go paste it into Claude in cursor, everything is right there.
And then if this script doesn't work first time, it's also going to be faster and easier to edit this in here rather than come back into here and wait for it to either write the script again or try and edit or tell us which bits to edit.
Now I'm not going to run those tests. We know that search terms is a pretty easy option for the AI to do.
Let's see how this one's going. Okay, so very similar. Hey, yes, so this one did do it without asking as many questions.
It's got the sheet URL top. If a URL isn't provided, create one. So I'm going to keep on that. looks very, very similar calculated metrics, it just guessed last days.
Oh that's one thing that we haven't done yet. I haven't shown you a way to do date ranges. All right, so let's try this.
Perfect. Let's make the date range more flexible. Have a constant at the top where the user can enter a number of days and then create a new function to create.
the code necessary and insert that into the query to get whichever date range the user wants. So the reason I'm trying to say it like that is to show you that you don't need to know exactly what you're talking about.
It's quite okay to say to the eye, I have no idea what I'm doing. Please can you do something like this for me?
I'm trying really hard not to use technical terms not to use jargon so that you can see that the AI will usually figure it out and if it doesn't, well we'll just test it, get an error and we'll try again and usually it only takes two or three off those.
So, okay that's an interesting way to do it. What it's going to do now is we've got a number of days at the top here and it's basically going to insert this line of text in here.
But it's going to work that out at this point. So it's saying, I'm going to put a bunch of text in here.
But just before we put the text in, hey, just run over here to this function, get date range and figure out how we actually format that and then grab the answer and return this back up into here.
I'm not going to test that right now. You don't need to see me testing more things. That looks like it'll probably work.
what I would prefer to do, oh, there we go, it is getting the time zone. So it's getting the time zone from our existing account to make sure that it formats that correctly and it does the time that in our time zone, which is perfect.
So that looks really good to me. So you can use this pattern, this function over and over again, you can either copy that into other scripts or you could just know that that's my one here.
You just need to say something like that. Let's make it more flexible. Please do this. Create a new function that does this.
This is kind of what I think I want. Or like just say, I want the option of making this run over days or days.
How do we do that? That will work too. So that's the mega prompt. Lots and lots of examples. One way I suggest you use this is as you build new examples and new test scripts, keep adding them to the examples at the bottom here.
And that's very easy to do, right? Let's, in fact, let's do it. Great, add the test.js file you just created, add that as a new example to the end of the Megaprompt.
There you go, look at that. And it even added that file for me, lovely. So rather than us have to copy and paste examples in, just get in the habit of asking the AI to do stuff for you.
Whenever I have text that needs formatting, I'll just ask the AI to do it or something that needs to be moved.
I'm now starting to, this is going to be a whole other course, talking about Claude code and how I use Claude code in cursor.
But I'm starting to use Claude code to manipulate files on my computer. So we can look at all of those SAM emails that we looked at and grab information from there or use Information from somewhere else in my computer pull all of that in use that as context in order to solve a business problem This so
much that we can do once you start exploring the rooms in that scary house start understanding how the Lego blocks work and The only way to figure that out is just to go play So go play, go experiment, go have fun, and when you get stuck, come and ping me in circle.
So come over to microbes.circle.so, weird URL, I know. And then come into this, members only ask questions section, put a post in there and just ping me on that, just at me says that I will see that I'm just trying to work out what I'm in here as I think yeah just you'll figure it out you're smart ping
me on there ask a question but just go have fun experiment and go build yeah

## Module 9: Copy My Code

### Video 9-1: Copy My Code (5 min)

This thing here. This is called a repository in GitHub. So GitHub is slightly different from Git. Git is kind of like, um, track changes in a word document.
Git Hub is basically Dropbox for all of your code. And so this repo, this repository, for scripts and sheets mastery contains this folder here with all of the various scripts that we have used throughout all of the modules.
Now on that first page you're looking for this big green button and then under this HTTPS section this line of code we just need to copy that URL and then what we're going to do is make a copy of this whole repo, this repository, we're going to clone the repo.
So now if we flick over to cursor, when you open a new window in cursor it looks like this you won't have this recent projects underneath, but you'll have these three options.
Up until now, you've probably just used this open project every time you go in, you probably open the same project.
As you build more and more different projects, you'll come in and choose which project to open or go into those recent ones.
For now, we're going to clone the repo. Very easy. We just need to paste in that line that we got from GitHub.
So github.com, microtideers, SSM git. And it's then going to ask us, where do we want to put that? Now I put all of my projects in the documents folder.
So I'm going to say, yep, put it in here please. It's going to say great, I've done all that. Do you want to open?
Yes please, open that. And now you have an exact copy of all of those files exactly the same as I had all of our four CS ones that we started with the apps script to take gmails into a sheet into a text doc we've got their health stuff we've got the MCC scripts from module whatever that was we've got
the mega prompt from the last module negative. That's the negative keyword script that works with both MCC and single. We've got some endgrams, we've got those simple search term ones, and the readme that explains how to use all of these, or what all of these are at least.
So now you've got all of that code to go play with. I highly recommend going through the videos and creating them from scratch yourself, but if you don't want to do that, you don't have time to do that.
Now you've got a copy of all of this And one thing that you'll find as you do more and more with code or maybe you've got this big library of code here when you make a change.
Let's just put a little space in there so that this file changes. It's now modified. I can now send all of my changes back up to GitHub.
So I can just say read me updated and I typically do this commit and sync and then it will Load up all of the files from here locally on my computer and Go save them all so it won't be six minutes ago.
It should say now if I refresh that There you go save all of those to get up So then if you want to share those with somebody else, please don't share these files with people that aren't in scripts and sheets mastery, but if you want to share this with yourself and make changes on one computer and then
get those changes to the other computer, this is a really easy way to do that. You work on one computer, make all of the changes, you're working away during the week, maybe you want to work on your laptop at the weekend, so you save all of that up to GitHub.
Everything in here then is the latest version, and then you go over to your laptop, copy that and clone the repo down onto your app top.
Work on there, save all the files, push them back to GitHub, and on Monday morning when you go back to the office, pull everything down onto your other computer.
That's a really easy way to move large chunks of code from one place to another. But this is kind of like the grown-up way to code.
I have no idea what I'm doing in here. I'll usually have to ask the AI for help with this whenever anything goes wrong with this GitHub stuff.
I'll just open up a new chat and ask it to fix it. Do that all the time. So if that was a bit confusing, don't worry.
Just ask the AI, say, hey, I want to clone this repo. How do I do it? And it'll say, well, first thing I need is the URL.
So find that, copy and paste it, give it to the AI, and then just follow your notes. You'll be fine.
There you go. All of the code from the whole workshop. Good luck, play and when you get stuck, ask an AI, and when you're still stuck, come over to Circle and ask me.
See you there, bye.
