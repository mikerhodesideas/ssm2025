Welcome back. In this video, I want to cover a couple more Google sheets formula. I want to cover array formula here and conditional formatting.
We've done pretty much everything else other than import range, but I'm going to use a different data set for import range to better, uh, demonstrate that one on also use something that I think would be more useful, uh, to you.
So array formula, what on earth is array formula? Well, let's use the example of row-as since most people people use rowers at some point.
What is rowers? It's the conversion value divided by the cost. And so if we're spending $and making three and a half grand, we've got a rowers of 
Now we could copy that down a few rows. And that's working out our rowers for each row. Say that three times quickly.
Now I could double click that, and it'll fill my formula all the way down to the bottom. But what happens if tomorrow, we have a different number of rows.
If I go and add five rows now, and let's say, you know, this data is automatically being added tomorrow, when the script runs again, there's no formula in these five cells.
Maybe in you campaign, God added, and so our data, the shape of our data is different, there's more rows next time, then if we're manually putting this formula in each row, then something's going to go and break.
So let's get rid of those rows again, and let's go back to the top, quickly delete all of those. What we want instead is a formula that says, hey, do this for every row please, and that's what the array formula does.
And so array formula just simply says, whatever formula comes next, do that for every row. And it works with just about every formula in the Google Sheet system.
So now what we have to do is it rather than just say, hey, go get Gand divide that by Elike we did before, that's not going to work.
Instead, we have to give it and array. So this is where you may want to lean on AI. Why don't we do that?
Let's do the same thing again and paste that in here and then say this is sample data from my Google sheet.
I want to create a formula for return on ad spend row as where I use an array formula to calculate the rowers for all rows of my sheet.
That formula is going to go into either, It's going to go in a column H. I'm not sure where to put it.
Please can you write that formula for me and tell me which cell to put the formula in? Let's assume that we've forgotten.
Should we do it with the header row or should we do it just with the data, I'm not quite sure.
So if column H is your row as a column, put this formula in HAnd again, gobbledygook, right? We don't want to have to remember how to do that.
And as soon as I pasted in, I didn't cheat, I didn't pause the video. As soon as I pasted that in, it completed the formula for me and it filled out all of those rows.
Now this time. These are all zero, so it's not really going to help. Let's grab a chunk of data from the top here.
And zoom down to the bottom and add five more rows. If I add additional data, so maybe new rows are created tomorrow, you can see instantly it automatically fills in the formula for these.
you can see there isn't a formula in this cell anymore there's just the value of the data because the formula is only in that cell right at the top and it's doing it all about actually now the one place you might get in trouble with rowers is if you have stuff in the way of this formula remember this
one formula is trying to fill every row in this column if there's stuff in the way you might get this little error here and says The result couldn't be graded because it would overwrite data in hthis one here if we got rid of that It would say hey, there's stuff in the way in hand we get rid of that
and then you get the picture as soon as we get rid of this It's able to do its thing and put that data in every row Did we want to use that?
No, I'm just talking with the idea of changing our chart to show this is because I put that data, that extra data at the bottom so it's getting a bit confused on a chart.
I was talking with the idea of charting row as instead of cost but maybe I'll let you have a go at doing that.
You figure out what would need to change hint maybe a query what would need to change in order to chart row as instead of cost hint hint hint.
Also that might need to change too because to begin with we said only go and get data in columns A through G and you might want to get column H as well now but I'll let you figure that one out.
All right the only other thing I want to cover in this video is conditional formatting. So before we had a lot of zeros on the chart down towards the bottom of this data set but it can kind of be a bit visually messy.
Sometimes these can get in the way a little bit. So one thing I like to do often is to highlight the whole tab, then I'll come into format and conditional formatting and say if the cell is equal to zero, I don't want to see it in green, thank you very much.
I don't want So that way, all of the zeros just kind of drop out of the way and it's just easier to see especially when it's lots and lots of zeros and a few bits of data.
It just makes the few bits of data kind of pop out of the screen more and easier to see. This reminds me of something else.
Let's do one more. So that's conditional formatting. You can use it for all kinds of different things. you can highlight rows where numbers are greater or equal than something else.
For instance, let's do cost, let's add another rule, such that if the cost is greater than or equal to a hundred, then we'll have the green box, otherwise we won't, and then we'll have another rule of If the cost is less than or equal to then let's have a red one done.
So now the higher numbers, that would have been smarter to use a slightly less common number. Our higher numbers are in green and our lower numbers are in red.
So it's really, really flexible, really useful to be able to make data pop out. But again, if you're doing a lot of the analysis in the Google sheet, I actually don't spend much time in a Google sheet anymore, because I'm doing everything in -or building little apps for stuff, but if you're spending
a lot of time in sheets, this is a very, very useful thing to know. Let's go fix that error that we saw before too.
So, row S, conversion value divided by cost, right? So if cost is zero in a few places and we get this horrible divide by zero error, well normally we'd have to change a bunch of different formulas because of that but we've got everything all in the one formula this whole column is managed by this array
formula so I think we might be able to wrap this big formula in this thing of if error And I put, if error, oops, let's go back into there, sorry, sorry, I can't make that row any bigger.
It doesn't matter how much I increase the zoom of this, it's a way, there is a way, there is a way, uh, usually increasing, oh that's, yeah, it's not really going to help too much but let's squish this over a little bit so we can still see this column and then this is hopefully a little bit bigger for
you to boot. So all I did I just added if error in here and then Google added the additional bracket that we needed because Google smart and it fills that stuff in for me but I've put it after the array formula.
So array formula and then said if there's no error basically that's If there's no error, then show the result of this.
If there is an error, just leave it blank. And I just like that. It's just a bit neater and tidier rather than having those div zero errors throughout your code.
Again, it just makes the data that you want to see kind of pop out and easier to spot. All right, in the next video, we will cover import range.
That's really the last Lego brick with all these Google sheet formulas that you really need but just sort of get I would suggest getting the habit of coming to your favorite AI whatever it is you use and getting in the habit of again like I did before just just talking through the problem I'm not trying
to be precise I'm I'm trying to demonstrate that on purpose by saying things like I'm not sure where to put it it's very vague it's it's really yet a year or two ago that probably wouldn't have worked but today's AI is that smart that it's going to figure out what you mean.
And this is why I love dictation software like whisper flow. It's so much better than the dictation that's built into Mac.
I've no idea what dictation out of the boxes like on PCs, but dictation on a map is Mac is pretty rubbish.
Whisper flow, which again, if you get a roads.ai, that will redirect you. You'll see this referral code on the end here.
You get $worth credits, I get $worth of credits. My kids get a Lego for Christmas and then you just go download that.
I think you can use it for free for the first words, something like that. I absolutely love this tool.
I use it all day every day now. Have been for months. Absolutely love it. I highly suggest working with it because you're able just to get more stuff out of your head faster than if you're having to type.
If as much context and AI needs context in order to help us to the more context you give it the better, which is why I show it, sample data and then just ramble for seconds and usually that's enough for it to figure out what I want.
If it doesn't figure it out first time, I'll come back in here and I'll ramble again for another seconds and then it's going to give me the answer I need.
So I'll see you back for one more. Google Sheet Formula which is import range in the next video.
